            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But I was glad to have the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion in the Reading this ſmall Piece, to obſerve and expoſe how reſtleſs a Paſſion <hi>Ambition</hi> is, and what different Ways it treads to compaſs its <hi>Deſignes;</hi> Though amongſt all the <hi>Methods</hi> that are uſed, none is more <hi>Plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,</hi> and in a fairer way of <hi>Succeſs,</hi> than this kind of <hi>Artifice,</hi> where the <hi>Impoſtor,</hi> upon his own Fund of <hi>Confidence,</hi> by perſonating <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,</hi> ſets up for <hi>Himſelf,</hi> and a <hi>Kingdom:</hi> And with ſuch <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Subtilty,</hi> puts on his borrowed <hi>Plumes,</hi> that the <hi>Fraud</hi> has not been ſoon, or perhaps never ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>diſcovered:</hi> But the <hi>End</hi> has generally proved Unfortunate.</p>

            <p>Where can we parallel ſuch an <hi>Impoſtor?</hi> Who had been long ſenſible of the warm Influence of <hi>Royal Favour,</hi> and had all his former <hi>Crimes</hi> buried in <hi>Oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> and yet that he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to his Vomit, by anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his <hi>Princes</hi> greateſt <hi>Enemies</hi> to his Deſtruction; and moſt ungratefully, when the <hi>Snuff</hi> of his deteſted <hi>Life</hi> is almoſt <hi>extinct,</hi> ſtill delude the VVorld with his borrowed <hi>Shapes</hi> and <hi>Diſguiſes;</hi> ſeducing his Country-men from

            <p>Nor can I leſs admire the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture</hi> of his Clyents, who being a Scandal to Debauchery, cry out, <hi>Great is Diana of the Epheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans! Our Religion! Our True Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion!</hi> To follow the

            </p>
            <p>Lord, how it ſhocks me! to think, that a <hi>Publican,</hi> and a <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> One that from <hi>Leathern Bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> ſhould by indirect means, ſo fill his <hi>Canvas,</hi> with the Stamp of <hi>Majesty,</hi> that he ſhould aim at a <hi>Peereage,</hi> and miſſing of it, ſhould

               <head>CHAP. I. <hi>Of the Falſe</hi> Smerdis.</head>
               <p>ONE of the moſt Profligate Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors I can write of, is the Counterfeit <hi>Smerdis,</hi> who was a <hi>Magus;</hi> which, taking the word in its moſt favourable Acceptation, ſignifies a <hi>Scholar,</hi> an <hi>Aſtrologer,</hi> or <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher:</hi>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:98570:10"/>But I am more inclin'd to believe he was a <hi>Magician;</hi> who for ſome Crime, eſcap'd the Juſtice of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> with the loſs of his Ears. The Frenzy and Diſtraction into which <hi>Cambyſes,</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and Son of <hi>Cyrus</hi> the Great, fell, gave this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor an Opportunity to ſhew himſelf; and, for eight Months, to aſcend the Throne of one of the Greateſt, and moſt Potent Empires in the Univerſe. For the King, when fallen into this Diſtemper, caus'd his only Brother to be put to Death, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then Governour of <hi>Perſia:</hi> Whoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon this <hi>Magician</hi> ſo acted, as obtain'd him the Quality and Empire of <hi>Smedis.</hi> The untimely Death of this Prince, gave him the Opportunity of being ſo great an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor; the Diſtraction of <hi>Cambyſes,</hi> was the cauſe of his Death; and the Sacrilege of <hi>Cambyſes,</hi> in mortally wounding the God <hi>Apis,</hi> of <hi>Epaphus,</hi> the Occaſion of that Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. This <hi>Apis</hi> the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Idolatory, ador'd in the Figure of a Calf. The Fable of this Divinity is known to proceed from <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s loving the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs <hi>Jo,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Inachus,</hi> King of <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicia; Juno</hi> contrived to ſurprize him with her: wherefore <hi>Jupiter</hi> turn'd her into an Heifer, to ſecure her againſt the Revenge and Jealouſie of the Goddeſs: But that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98570:10"/>was not ſufficient to extinguiſh her Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſuſpitions, which prompted her to beg that beautiful Cow of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> who could find no excuſe to deny her. <hi>Juno</hi> committed her to the keeping of <hi>Argus</hi> with his hundred Eyes; at which, <hi>Jupiter</hi> being extreamly vext, ſent <hi>Mercury</hi> his Baſtard, and ſtole her away while <hi>Argus</hi> ſlept: This ſo engaged <hi>Juno,</hi> that her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge fell on <hi>Jo,</hi> whom ſhe commanded the fury <hi>Erinnys</hi> to make diſtracted, and poſſeſs with wild Fancies, which made her wander about the World; untill grown weary and Faint, ſhe ſtopt in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> where ſhe was reſtor'd to her former Shape and Perſon, and brought to Bed of <hi>Epaphus;</hi> The <hi>Egyptians</hi> Worſhipping both her, and her Son. <hi>Ovid</hi> tells this Story at the end of his firſt Book of <hi>Metamorphoſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cambyſes,</hi> although the eldeſt Son, and Succeſſor to ſo great a King, and in the Poſſeſſion of ſuch mighty Provinces as the <hi>Perſiaen</hi> Empire contain'd, burn'd with an unlimited Ambition to extend his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, which he did over <hi>Aegypt;</hi> ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping <hi>Pſalmneticus</hi> the King, Son of <hi>Amaſis</hi> the Uſurper, of all Regal Power: But this not being enough for his vaſt Thoughts; he undertook three great Wars, at the ſame time, though very unſeaſonably, and to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98570:11"/>his diſadvantage; making the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> the <hi>Aethiopians;</hi> and the <hi>Arabians</hi> his Enemies. Againſt each of theſe he had ill Succeſs: He could not attack the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians,</hi> but by Sea; and the <hi>Phoenici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> his only Subjects that could aſſiſt him with Ships, mutin'd, and refuſed to lend him any; belleving it unnatural to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute towards the Ruin of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> who proceeded from them. To advance towards <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> the Army had vaſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts to march over; and this young un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſed King took ſo ill Meaſures, and made ſo ſmall Proviſions, that he hardly got the Fifth Part of the way, ere his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my wanted, and were forced to eat their own Horſes, and Camels; and afterward, by Decimation and Lot, to feed on every Tenth Man; till at laſt, he, with the Wrack of this miſerable Army, got back to <hi>Thebes</hi> in <hi>Aegypt.</hi> The Third, which was of Fifty Thouſand Men, was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to waſte the Country round the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Jupiter Hammon,</hi> and to burn that famous Temple, with the Statue of <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> When they had advanc'd as far as the City <hi>Oaſis,</hi> ſeven days Journey beyond <hi>Thebes,</hi> being the mid-way to the Town of <hi>Daſis,</hi> (the Country they were to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack) they halted in a Valley; where an
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98570:11"/>impetuous Wind, blowing Mountains of Sand from all parts, buried them together, not one eſcaping; ſo that <hi>Cambyſes</hi> could have no other News, but only the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of this Accident.</p>
               <p>The God <hi>Apis,</hi> ſo much ador'd by the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> ſhew'd himſelf that Year, which he had not done along time before. Theſe blind People, when they found a Calf of extraordinary Largeneſs and Beauty, made it their Falſe God, uſing all Shews of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Joy they could expreſs. <hi>Cambyſes,</hi> being angry, and ill humour'd with his late Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſters, believed they rejoyced at his ill For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and took a Pretext to do it for the Apparition of their God. He was then at <hi>Memphis;</hi> where he commanded the Magiſtrates to come before him, and give an Account, why they took ſo ill a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture for their Mirth and Feaſting. No Excuſes would ſerve, nor no Submiſſions prevail; but he cauſed them all to be put to Death. He alſo commanded the Prieſts of <hi>Apis</hi> to be brought, with the Calf they ador'd; which was black, and had a large ſquare Spot in his Fore head; another in the reſemblance of an Eagle on his Back; a Croſs under his Jaws; and at the End of his Tail, a thick forked Tuff of Hair. <hi>Cambyſes</hi> drew his Sword, and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98570:12"/>him in the Ham, though his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was to have kill'd him; calling the Prieſts contemptuous Names, ſaying, <hi>You deſerve no better Gods, than Fleſh and Blood, that can feel and ſmart with a Wound.</hi> Then, in deriſion, caus'd them to be cruelly bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, commanding his Guards to kill who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they found rejoycing on that Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This ſevere Order ſoon put an end to their Feaſting: The God <hi>Apis</hi> was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into the Temple, where he languiſh't till he died, and was privately buried by his Prieſts. Heaven, as the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, puniſh'd <hi>Cambyſes</hi> for theſe Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, taking away his Reaſon, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him diſtracted. One of the ſaddeſt Effects of his Frenzy, was, the Death of his own Brother <hi>Smerdis,</hi> a very accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd Prince, and of ſo extraordinary Strength, that it cauſed his Brother's Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy ſo far, as to deny him Acceſs to his Perſon, by ſending him into <hi>Perſia</hi> while he remain'd in <hi>Aegypt.</hi> His Ambaſſadors, or rather his Spies in <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> amongſt other Rarities, brought home with them a Bow, of ſo large a ſize, that no <hi>Perſian</hi> had ſtrength enough to bend it, but <hi>Smerdis</hi> only, who did it with two Fingers; which was the firſt ſubject of his Diſgrace, as that which follows was the cauſe of his Death.</p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:98570:12"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cambyſes</hi> dream't, that a <hi>Courrier</hi> came in great haſte, &amp; brought him news, that <hi>Smer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> ſat on his Throne, &amp; that his Head reacht Heaven. This made him reſolve his Death; and gave <hi>Prexaſpes,</hi> one of his Officers, Orders to ſee it done; which he did near <hi>Suſa,</hi> as he accompany'd him a Hunting: Others ſay, It was by throwing him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> as he walk'd on the Cliffs. I need but mention the other Cruelties of <hi>Cambyſes;</hi> The Murthering one of his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, whom he had Marry'd, kicking her many times on the Belly, when ſhe was with Child, of which ſhe died: The Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſhe gave him, was wittily reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him of his Killing <hi>Smerdis.</hi> He ſhot the Son of <hi>Prexaſpes</hi> with an Arrow, and then rip't him open; ſo paying his Father for Murthering <hi>Smerdis.</hi> He put twelve of his great Lords to a cruel Death, burying them alive, with their Heads downwards; and would have kill'd the beſt of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, the wiſe and famous <hi>Croeſus;</hi> who loſt his Kingdom of <hi>Lydia,</hi> with his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe Riches; on whom <hi>Cyrus,</hi> his Father, had pity. Theſe were the Praeludes, or rather the Cauſes, which preceded and encourag'd this Impudent <hi>Impoſtor,</hi> of whom we treat.</p>
               <p>During the time <hi>Cambyſes</hi> committed theſe Exceſſes of Cruelties, and that his
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98570:13"/>Frenzy made him more hated, than a wild Beaſt; there were two Brothers, by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion <hi>Magicians;</hi> One of them, called <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tazithes,</hi> was an Officer of his Houſe: Theſe conſpir'd againſt him. <hi>Patazithes,</hi> knowing the Death of <hi>Smerdis,</hi> which was hid from the <hi>Perſians,</hi> had Inſolence e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to undertake this Enterprize, which follows: He had a Brother of the Age and Features of <hi>Smerdis,</hi> and of his Name alſo; him he contrived to ſet on the Throne, and inſtructed him in all the Arts he ſhould uſe. He ſent Heralds into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the Officers of the Army, for the future, to obey <hi>Smerdis,</hi> the Son of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus;</hi> and no longer to own Allegiance to <hi>Cambyſes:</hi> Theſe Heralds ſo well acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves of their Commiſſion, that one of them met <hi>Cambyſes</hi> with his Army at <hi>Echatana</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> to whom he boldly ſhewed his Order; who was aſtoniſh'd at his Reſoiution; and turning towards <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xaſpes,</hi> ſpoke to him in theſe words: <hi>Is it thus, you have executed the Commands I gave you? No, Sir,</hi> (replyed <hi>Prexaſpes</hi>) <hi>it is not true, that your Brother can ever Rebel, or Fight more or leſs againſt your Authority; for with my own Hands I obey'd your Orders: And if thoſe who are out of the World can fight, you have more reaſon to apprehend</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtyages,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98570:13"/>
                  <hi>King of the</hi> Medes; <hi>but if your Majeſty have no cauſe to think of him, you have no other to fear your Brother</hi> Smerdis. <hi>I beſeech you, Sir,</hi> (continued he) <hi>grant me ſome of your Guards, to purſue this Herald, and bring him back, that you may learn from him, if he have ſeen, or ſpoke to</hi> Smerdis. This Advice pleaſed the King: The He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald was brought back, and ask't, <hi>If he received his Orders from the Mouth of</hi> Smer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis, <hi>or from ſome of his Miniſters only?</hi> He ingenuouſly confeſt, he had not ſeen him, ſince the War <hi>Cambyſes</hi> made in <hi>Aegypt;</hi> but had his Orders from the <hi>Magician,</hi> whom his Majeſty made Intendant of his Affairs in <hi>Perſia;</hi> who ſaid in theſe words: Smerdis, <hi>the Son of</hi> Cyrus, <hi>commands this to be done. Cambyſes</hi> was ſatisfied by this Anſwer, that <hi>Prexaſpes</hi> had obey'd him; whom he otherwiſe had certainly put to Death. He ask't him, If he could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, who were the Authors of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion and Impoſture? <hi>I doubt</hi> (ſaid <hi>Prexaſpes</hi>) <hi>they were the Magicians</hi> Pataz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes, <hi>Governour of the Houſhold, and</hi> Smer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis <hi>his Brother.</hi> When <hi>Cambyſes</hi> heard the Name of <hi>Smerdis,</hi> he ſeem'd Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruck, remembring the Truth of his Dream; and knowing too late his fatal Error, wept bitterly for his double Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98570:14"/>of his Brother and Siſter: In this tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport of Grief, haſtily mounting his Horſe, to chaſtiſe the Rebels at <hi>Suſa,</hi> the Scab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard of his Sword dropt off, and he found himſelf wounded in the ſame Place, with the Point, where he hurt the God <hi>Apis.</hi> It ſurpriz'd him more, when they told him, He was in <hi>Echatana</hi> in <hi>Syria:</hi> The O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of <hi>Butis</hi> having foretold he ſhould die in <hi>Echatana,</hi> he believed it the great City of that Name in <hi>Media;</hi> where he kept his Treaſure, and commonly reſided: Flattering himſelf he ſhould end his days there, in his old Age; but troubled at the Impoſture of the <hi>Magician,</hi> and grieved for the Exceſſes of his paſt Life, his Wound having made him languiſh twenty days, he ſent for the moſt conſiderable Officers, and ſpoke thus to them: <hi>Fate will, that</hi> Cambyſes, <hi>the Son of</hi> Cyrus, <hi>die here; and now I am conſtrain'd</hi> (<hi>my dear</hi> Perſians) <hi>to diſcover what I have hid from you hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. When I was in</hi> Aegypt <hi>I dreamt a Dream, which made me fear my Brother ſhould uſurp my Crown: This Fear made me act with more Precipitancy, than Reaſon; (I find Man has not the Power to hinder what ſhall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen) I too raſhly ſent</hi> Prexaſpes <hi>to kill</hi> Smer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis <hi>at</hi> Suſa: <hi>After which Crime, I thought my ſelf ſecure; not imagining, when he was
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98570:14"/>out of the World, any mortal Creature dar'd to riſe up againſt me: But I ſee I am miſerably abuſed, and have been, to no purpoſe, my Brother's Murtherer: For, notwithſtanding I am rob'd of my Empire, it was this</hi> Smer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis <hi>the</hi> Magician, <hi>the Doemon ſhew'd me in my Sleep; and 'tis he, was to take Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me. Think not, when I am gone, to have</hi> Smerdis, <hi>the Son of</hi> Cyrus, <hi>for your King: They are two</hi> Magicians, <hi>would have the Empire; One I made Governour of my Houſe; the Other is</hi> Smerdis, <hi>his Brother.

               <p>Having ended this Diſcourſe, he wept abundantly, deploring his ſo early Fate: The <hi>Perſians</hi> that were by, found his griefs ſo moving, they tore their Garments, and ſhed many Tears, crying out for ſorrow.

               <p>The truth of the Impoſture, and Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the Magicians, could not enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the minds of the <hi>Perſians;</hi> it ſeem'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible to them; They thought the Death of <hi>Smerdis,</hi> of which <hi>Cambyſes</hi> informed them, was only a Pretext to make the Name of the <hi>Perſians</hi> odious, and believed firmly that <hi>Smerdis,</hi> by this Rebellion, had placed himſelf on the Throne: Which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion they continued in the longer, by <hi>Prexaſpes</hi>'s utterly denying the Murther, though if he had own'd it, he had certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been deſtroy'd, when <hi>Cambyſes</hi> was Dead, who authorized and avow'd it; for the <hi>Perſians</hi> would have been very rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous with him, that had dar'd to ſhed the Blood of that Great King <hi>Cyrus.</hi>

He ſent his Proclamations through all the Provinces, to exempt the People from Taxes, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them Peace, and Reſt; Declaring he he would Liſt no Souldiers for the War, in three Years: But in Eight Months his Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany was in this manner detected.</p>

                  <hi>Otanes,</hi> Son of <hi>Pharnaſpes,</hi> who was one of the greateſt Lords of <hi>Perſia,</hi> ſuſpected the Magician not to be <hi>Smerdis,</hi> the Son of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and his ſuſpition was grounded on his recluſe way of Living; for he never came out of the Palace, nor gave Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or acceſs to any <hi>Perſian</hi> Lord.

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98570:16"/>found he had none, and early in the Morning gave her Father notice. <hi>Otanes</hi> inform'd <hi>Aſpathines</hi> and <hi>Gobrias</hi> of this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, who before extreamly ſuſpected it; therefore were eaſily perſwaded of the Truth: 'Twas their opinion, each of them ſhould chooſe a Colleague, able to Act, and adviſe with them. <hi>Otanes</hi> took <hi>Intaphernes; Gobrias, M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

When it came to <hi>Darius</hi> his turn, he ſpoke in this manner. <hi>For my part, I believ'd no body knew the</hi> Magician <hi>Reign'd; but my ſelf; and that</hi> Smerdis, <hi>the Son of</hi> Cyrus, <hi>was not in the World. I came hither on purpoſe to exterminate this Impoſtor; but ſince I find you are all equally inform'd of it, I think it convenient now to agree, what is to be done, and not defer it a moment; for there can be no advantage in long debates. Ota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> reply'd, <hi>My Dear Son, thou ſpeakeſt like the Son of</hi> Hyſtaſpes, <hi>a Man of Gallantry and Honour, with whom thou doſt equally poſſeſs Prudence and Courage; however let us not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98570:17"/>the Execution of ſuch an affair, but with mature deliberation let us undertake and proceed in it.</hi> Then <hi>Darius</hi> replying, ſaid; <hi>Know my Lords here preſent, that if you fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the opinion of</hi> Otanes, <hi>you are all ruin'd: For ſome body, for his particular intent, will diſcover this matter to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper: and therefore you that firſt began to execute the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, becauſe you have thought ſit to truſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Perſons, and me alſo, let us go through with it this Day: For know, that if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to paſs it, I will prevent my being the Sacrifice of another Mans Peace, and firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to the</hi> Magicians, <hi>what will deſtroy you all.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Otanes,</hi> conſidering the determination of <hi>Darius,</hi> ſaid, <hi>Since you ſo much reſolve to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten this affair, tell us how we ſhall get arm'd into the Palace, and attack the Impoſtor? You know (at leaſt, by Fame) the Guards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Perſon are very ſtrong; How then ſhall we make our way to him? Darius</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, <hi>There are many things,</hi> (<hi>my dear</hi> Otanes) <hi>that are more eaſily executed than projected; as there are alſo ſeveral, which ſeem plain in the diſcourſing of whoſe Succeſs is doubtful. You may reaſonably ſuppoſe, we ſhall find no great difficulty in paſſing his Guards, being ſo many of the chief Perſons in the Empire; we ſhall meet no Man dare ſtop
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98570:17"/>us; but rather give us place, either for Fear, or Reſpect. I have, at leaſt, a pretention not to be deny'd: I came now from</hi> Perſia, <hi>and can tell them, I have Affairs of the greateſt conſequence to acquaint the King with, from my Father, who is Governor there: A Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be allowed, when Neceſſity requires it: Truth and Falſhood have oft' the ſame end; For who uſes the former, aims at their own Advantage, and the latter ſerves to perſwade what we deſire. As to the Guards of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended King; If they let us paſs quietly, and without reſiſtance, they will have no occaſion to repent it; and we ſhall have an opportunity to reward them, as they merit: But if any reſiſt our intent, we muſt uſe them like Enemies; and being entred, reſolve to execute our great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gobrias</hi> extreamly approved this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; and further added, <hi>My Dear and Honoured Friends, It will be much more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for us, to tear the Empire from this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper, or if we can't, to die in ſo noble an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; than for us</hi> Perſians <hi>to obey a</hi> Mede, <hi>whoſe Ears have been cut off for his Crimes; eſpecially if we call to our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, what</hi> Cambyſes <hi>recommended to us on his Death-bed, with all the Imprecations ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable; if we ſuffered ſuch an Ignominy, and loſt the Empire to the</hi> Medes. <hi>We then belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98570:18"/>not whathe ſaid, we could not perſwade our ſelves, neither of his Brothers Murther, nor of the Magitians inſolence, to gain the Crown by ſo baſe an Impoſture. I am now convinced by</hi> Dari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us; <hi>and am of the Opinion, That immediately, and without ſeparating, we ſhould go from this place to the Palace, and execute our deſigne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They all agreed to what <hi>Gobrias</hi> propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. But while theſe ſeven Illuſtrious <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Lords were conſulting, the Magicians <hi>Patizithes</hi> and <hi>Smerdis,</hi> were thinking how they might ſtrengthen their Uſurpations, by obtaining the Friendſhip of <hi>Prexaſpes,</hi> in whom they believed great diſpoſitions towards it. <hi>Cambyſes</hi> having ſhot his Son with an Arrow; his exceſs of Cruelty not ſatisfied with that, uſed him yet more barbarouſly, ripping him open, to ſhew his skill in ſhooting through his Heart, boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his nimbleneſs and dexterity. <hi>Prexaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes</hi> onely had the certain knowledge of <hi>Smerdis</hi>'s death, having murther'd him with his own hands, to obey the impious and unnatural Cruelty of <hi>Cambyſes,</hi> which made; him odious to all the <hi>Perſians</hi> that ſuſpected it. They ſent for him to the Palace, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing him Wonders, and obliging him to take an oath of Secrecy, not to diſcover how they had Uſurpt the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy. <hi>Prexaſpes</hi> promiſed them all they deſired.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98570:18"/>The Magicians finding him ſo much inclin'd to their purpoſe, told him their Intention to aſſemble the <hi>Perſians,</hi> at the foot of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, and that he ſhould go with them, and from the top of a Tower aſſure the People, no other than <hi>Smerdis</hi> the Son of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> was their preſent King. They choſe him ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than any other, becauſe of his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and his often Proteſting, on ſeveral oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, he had not kill'd <hi>Smerdis,</hi> as he was ſuſpected to have done; even this alſo he promiſed them. They aſſembled the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> ordering he ſhould aſcend the Tower, to make his Speech, as they had agreed: But he forgot, on purpoſe, what the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians deſired him to ſay, and diſcours'd of <hi>Achemenis,</hi> the firſt of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Line; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the Progreſs and the Particulars of that Illuſtrious Family; and coming to <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> he ſhew'd them the great things he had done for the <hi>Perſian</hi> Nation. After this, he told them the truth of all, alleadging for his Excuſe, the fear he had of Death, if he had open'd his lips; but being then forced to ſpeak, he declared the real truth, that he had murthered <hi>Smerdis,</hi> the Son of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> by the moſt expreſs Command of <hi>Cambyſes;</hi> and that thoſe who now poſſeſt the Rega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, were Magicians, and Impoſtors, calling for Curſes on the <hi>Perſians</hi> heads, if they did
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98570:19"/>not tear it from them, and take Vengeance on their deceit. After which he threw himſelf down from the Tower on the Pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. To give him his due, he was a man of extraordinary Merit, excepting his guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Obedience to <hi>Cambyſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe ſeven Lords reſolved, to attack the Magicians immediately, after having recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the Succeſs of their Enterprize to their Gods. They knew nothing that had arrived to <hi>Prexaſpes,</hi> till by the way, they heard the ſurprizing Cataſtrophe; and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a private place, a little out of the ſtreet, diſcourſed what was to be done, ſince this laſt Conjuncture: Thoſe who had been of the ſame Opinion with <hi>Otanes,</hi> perſiſted in their firſt Sentiments to defer the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, becauſe of this Accident; But they who agreed with <hi>Darius,</hi> perſevered that there was no time to be loſt; but immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to advance to the Palace, and finiſh their Reſolutions in ſo juſt a deſigne. While they were in this Debate, they obſerved ſeven Faulcons purſuing two Vultures: This they took for a good <hi>Augury</hi> of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Execution of their Enterprize, and went boldly to the Palace. When they came to the outward Gate, it happened, as <hi>Darius</hi> had foreſeen; The Guards having ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for the great Lords of the Empire, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98570:19"/>no <hi>Accident</hi> from thoſe who appear'd in ſo much Pomp and Majeſty; not ſo much as asking, <hi>If they were ſent for?</hi> or, <hi>What they deſired?</hi> When they entred the Court of the Palace, they met ſeveral Eunuches that went on Meſſages, and introduced thoſe who had any affairs in the Court: Theſe demanded the occaſion of their coming, chiding the Porters, and threatning a ſevere Puniſhment for ſuffering any to paſs; and at the ſame time, putting themſelves in a poſture, to hinder their advancing further. Whereupon theſe Illuſtrious Confederates gave each other the Signal, and drawing their Swords from under their Veſts, ſoon laid the Eunuchs on the Ground, running with all the haſt imaginable to the <hi>Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> Apartment; where they found them together, conſulting on the laſt Accident of <hi>Prexaſpes.</hi> When hearing the Crys of the Eunuchs, and perceiving what was done, they made a Vertue of Neceſſity, and ſtood upon their Defence; one ſeizing a Bow, and the other a Lance: The firſt was uſeleſs againſt men that were ſo near, and aimed at their heads; the other defended himſelf valiantly with the Lance, or rather a Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beard, with which he wounded <hi>Aſpathynes</hi> in the Thigh, and ſtruck out one of <hi>Inta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phernes</hi> his Eyes; but none of theſe ſeven
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98570:20"/>Lords were kill'd. He that could not uſe the Bow, ſled into a Chamber, where he lay endeavouring to barricade the Door; but <hi>Darius</hi> and <hi>Gobrias,</hi> entering at the ſame time with him, prevented his Intentions. The Room was dark, and the Windows ſhut; this pretended King affecting ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure places. <hi>Gobrias</hi> cloſed with him, and <hi>Darius</hi> fear'd to run his Sword into the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician,</hi> leſt he ſhould kill his Friend by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake; but <hi>Gobrias</hi> calling to him, chid him for his delay, chuſing rather to be kill'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, than ſave the <hi>Impoſtor. Darius</hi> either by his Voice, or his own good Fortune, took his meaſures ſo well, that he onely woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the <hi>Magician,</hi> with that ſtroak laying him on the Ground.</p>
               <p>Five of theſe Lords, Deliverers of their Country, went out with the Heads of the <hi>Magicians,</hi> leaving <hi>Aſpathynes</hi> and <hi>Intapher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> wounded in the Palace, to ſecure that, whilſt they ſhew'd the People what they had done, telling the reaſon of their Exploit, and killing all the <hi>Magicians</hi> they met. The <hi>Perſians</hi> were Raviſht for Joy of his Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick Action, being inraged at the ſame time againſt all they thought <hi>Magicians,</hi> they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd many; and had not the Night hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them, none would have eſcapt.

               <p>When <hi>Otho</hi> govern'd <hi>Rome,</hi> both <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Aſia</hi> were alarm'd with the Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of <hi>Nero</hi>'s being alive; many and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent were the Stories of his death; ſome reporting, others, believing he was yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</p>
               <p>A Slave who came from <hi>Pontus</hi> in <hi>Aſia,</hi> or (as others ſay) an <hi>Italian</hi> Free-Man, who could ſing, and play on the Harp; which, with the Reſemblance of his Face, did not a little ſerve to perſwade the World he was the true <hi>Nero.</hi> He gathered many Fugitives, and Vagabonds, that knew not where to go, o'recome with Want and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, to whom he made mighty Promiſes. Taking ſhipping with them, he was driven by a Storm on the Iſle of <hi>Cynthus,</hi> or <hi>Delos;</hi> where the Mountain <hi>Cynthus</hi> was conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Apollo,</hi> or to <hi>Diana.</hi> There he got more Souldiers, who were coming from the Eaſt; deſtroying thoſe who refuſed his Service. He plundered all the Merchants in the Iſland, giving Arms to the moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous Slaves he could find. But he try'd by all poſſible means, to gain <hi>Siſenna,</hi> a Centurian in the <hi>Syrian</hi> Army, and ſent part of that Army to <hi>Rome,</hi> to make a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Union with the <hi>Pretorian Cohorts,</hi> or Regiment of the Guards; carrying with
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98570:23"/>them, for the Symbole of that Unity they deſired, the Figure of Right Hands joyn'd together. This Captain he try'd ſo many ways to make of his Party, as obliged him to ſteal privately out of the Iſland, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding the Violence and Danger that threatned him. Theſe Proceedings car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Terrour and Fear of the ſuppoſed <hi>Nero</hi> very far; many unquiet Minds taking this occaſion of diſturbance; ſome through the deſire of Novelty, others in diſlike of the preſent Government, diſperſing the News of <hi>Nero</hi>'s Return.</p>
               <p>The Emperour <hi>Galba</hi> had given the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Galatia</hi> and <hi>Pamphilia,</hi> to <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purnius Aſprenas,</hi> and two Gallies were ordered to conduct him. Theſe caſting Anchornear this Iſland, the Impoſtor much deſired to be Maſter of; which, not being able to effect openly, he try'd to accompliſh by Art; and putting himſelf into a ſmall Veſſel, not knowing any thing of a <hi>Roman</hi> Governour, deſired he might come on Board and tranſport himſelf into <hi>Syria</hi> or <hi>Egypt.</hi> Standing on the Prow of his Ship, looking ſad and diſconſolate, he admoniſhed the Souldiers to think of the Oath of Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, they had ſworn to him heretofore. Then directing himſelf to the Pilots, they made ſome difficulty to receive him, ſaying,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98570:23"/>
                  <hi>They were not Maſters, but would ask their Commander;</hi> doing this for an Amuſement, that they might the better ſurprize him. They informed <hi>Aſprenas</hi> of what had paſt, who conſidering the Veſſel the Impoſtor was in, not to be of any great Force, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately commanded to attack her; but he took her not without a ſmart diſpute, the falſe <hi>Nero</hi> Valiantly fighting till he dyed. His Body, remarkable for his fine Hair, and great Eyes, but above all, for the Fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Countenance, was carried to <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> where it lay expos'd to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ones Admiration, and to conſider his Inſolence, that durſt attempt to uſurp the greateſt Emprire of the World.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>ADrian</hi> having ſucceeded <hi>Trajan</hi> the Emperour, in the 4080th Year of the World, and of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the 118th, found the ſame Diſpoſitions of Revolting in the minds of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that his Predeceſſors had done. So he recall'd <hi>Jul.

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98570:24"/>Therefore ſpent time, and prolong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the War; which gave the Jews oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to augment their Strength.</p>
               <p>The better to increaſe their Army, and heighten their Courage, they took Religion for a pretence; the Head of the Seditious calling himſelf the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> and to make the nearer Alluſion to the Prophecy in the 24th of <hi>Numbers,</hi> where the great Legiſlator <hi>(Moſes)</hi> ſays, <hi>A Star ſhall come out of</hi> Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, he took the Name of <hi>Benchochab, Son of the Star,</hi> or (as ſome will) <hi>Barcochab;</hi> but 'tis all one: for <hi>Ben</hi> and <hi>Bar</hi> both ſignifie a <hi>Son.</hi> This <hi>Impoſtor</hi> poſſeſt, for ſix years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, fifty Caſtles beſides four hundred and eighty Towns and Villages.

The Emperour <hi>Adrian</hi> coming in perſon againſt it; 'tis hardly to be believed what Reſiſtance the Beſieged made, how many Sallies, and what Blood was ſpilt: We find written, that three hundred thouſand <hi>Jews</hi> were ſlain, beſides vaſt numbers who periſht by Plague, and Hunger; 'Tis ſaid to the number of 500000 Men, if we may believe <hi>Carion</hi>'s Chronicle. <hi>Bencochab</hi> was kill'd in a Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98570:25"/>after whoſe Death <hi>Bethoron</hi> was taken. The <hi>Jews,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Bencochab,</hi> call him <hi>Benſcosba,</hi> or the <hi>Son of Deceit,</hi> having falſly call'd himſelf the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> The Emperour writ excellent Letters on this occaſion, of his Victory, as equal with the greateſt had ever been obtained, ſince it gave Peace to all the Eaſt. This Impoſtor had ſuch an inveterate hatred to the Chriſtians, that all thoſe who fell under his power, he put to cruel Deaths.</p>
               <p>The Emperour <hi>Adrian,</hi> having razed the City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> reſolved to rebuild it, calling it <hi>Elia Adriana;</hi> he forbad entrance into it, or habitation there, to the <hi>Jews;</hi> but allowed both to the Chriſtians.</p>

               <p>IN the time of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Emperour, who Reigned from the year 412, until 454, a wicked <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Impoſtor appeared in <hi>Candia,</hi> calling himſelf <hi>Moſes;</hi> promiſing the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were in great numbers in that Inſulary Kingdom, he would lead them through the Sea on foot, without the help of Ships, into their old Country <hi>Judea,</hi> as he had formerly done their Fathers, in the time of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> King of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and by the ſame means, deliver them from Servitude; that he had already done it, in the year of the World 2454, being 2050 years before this Counterfeit appeared; the preſent Story happening in the 4420th year of the World.</p>
               <p>He further perſwaded them, he was the ſame Prophet <hi>Moſes,</hi> whom <hi>God</hi> had ſent from Heaven, to be their Guide. He went about the Iſland for a year together, incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98570:26"/>theſe Perſwaſions into the People, and aſſign'd them a certain Day to begin their Journey. He pretended to prophecy, and gathered Money on all hands; and at the day appointed, led Multitudes of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the Sea-ſide; where commanding ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral to leap in, their Folly and Blindneſs was ſo great, to obey him; many of them being ſwallowed by the Waters: and if ſome Fiſher-men had not been near, and charitably ſaved ſeveral with their Barques, calling to thoſe on the Shore, not to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they had many of them periſht, who by their means were ſaved.

               <p>Sometime after <hi>Gondoald</hi>'s Arrival, the Empreſs <hi>Sophia,</hi> perſwaded by the Enemies of <hi>Narſes</hi>'s Glory, recalled him into <hi>Italy,</hi> and alſo treated him with great Scorn and Contempt; ſaying, <hi>He was ſitter to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute Wooll to her Women, and to the Maids of her Seraglio to ſpin, than to command an
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98570:30"/>Army.</hi> Which Expreſſions he ſo much reſented, that he called <hi>Alboin</hi> his Friend, King of the <hi>Lombards,</hi> out of <hi>Hungary,</hi> to come into <hi>Italy;</hi> who made ſuch a Progreſs there, that this moſt wiſe Empreſs was not able to put a ſtop to. <hi>Gondoald</hi> hoped conſiderable Aſſiſtance from <hi>Alboin,</hi> with which he deſigned to take from his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>Sigebert, Chilperic,</hi> and <hi>Gontran,</hi> who bore the Titles of Kings of <hi>Mets, Paris,</hi> and <hi>Orleans</hi> (the Cities where they lived, and kept their Courts) a more conſiderable Kingdom, than either of them poſſeſt. <hi>Narſes</hi> being naturally Merciful, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, was perſwaded by the Entreaty of Pope <hi>John</hi> the Third, who came to meet him at <hi>Naples,</hi> how pernicious the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence muſt be, of <hi>Alboin</hi>'s coming into <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly,</hi> and conjured him to countermand and hinder it all he could. When the <hi>Pope</hi> and he were returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> and conſidering how they might remedy this Misfortune, <hi>Narſes</hi> died, whoſe <hi>body</hi> was carried to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> and there magnificently buried.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gondoald,</hi> after this Accident, croſſed the Sea, and made his Court to the Emperour <hi>Juſtin,</hi> and the Empreſs <hi>Sophia</hi> his Wife, an Ambitious and Airy Princeſs: His good Meen and Intriguing Humour made him extreamly conſidered in that Court. <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerationem

               <p>During the Reign of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> which was ſeven years, he made ſeveral Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigns in the Wars of <hi>Perſia,</hi> under <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritius,</hi> who was after choſen Emperour, and Succeſſor to <hi>Tiberius:</hi> for <hi>Gondoald</hi> dared not to venture himſelf in the Court of <hi>France,</hi> where he had been ſo ill treated, having many ſad Examples of his Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Cruelty, even to their own Blood. <hi>Clotaire,</hi> his Father, without Pity or Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, burnt <hi>Cramnus</hi> or <hi>Granus,</hi> his own Son, with his Wiſe, and Children, in a Houſe where they Fled for Refuge: He overcame, &amp; kill'd in Battle <hi>Senabut,</hi> Duke of <hi>Britain:</hi> He Burnt <hi>Conobald,</hi> Duke of <hi>Guienne,</hi> in the Chappel of S. <hi>Martin,</hi> where he ran for ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; becauſe he had aſſiſted <hi>Granus,</hi> in his Revolt; to whom he Married his Daughter.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Clotaire</hi> alſo was Guilty of that abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable <hi>parricide,</hi> of <hi>dipping</hi> his <hi>hands</hi> in the Innocent Blood of his two young Nephews, <hi>Theobald</hi> and <hi>Gontier,</hi> Sons of <hi>Cladomir,</hi> his Brother, King of <hi>Orleans.

Theſe two Women diſturbed all <hi>France;</hi> Their Husbands having been Traitorouſly Murthered, which was the occaſion of his Return, after having been Twenty Years in the Eaſt. He Landed at <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> with a ſplendid Equipage; where <hi>Theodore,</hi> Biſhop of that Dioceſs, received him with much Honour, it being reported he brought Vaſt Riches along with him, and was able to give great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, having made the beſt Advantage of his Happineſs in the Eaſtern Court; beſides the finding a mighty Treaſure, hid by <hi>Narſes</hi> the Eunuch. His Royal Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Majeſtick Perſon, were admired;
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:98570:31"/>The Fame of his Actions having gain'd him the Reputation of a good Captain, &amp; Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, to the Incomparable General <hi>Narſes. Didier,</hi> who abſolutely Commanded the Countrys adjacent, to <hi>Tholouſe; Mummol;</hi> much talkt of for his Service in the Wars againſt the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Lombards,</hi> and thought one of the beſt Souldiers in his time, (beſides many Lords both <hi>Viſigoths,</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> who kept the Frontiers of <hi>Spain</hi>) declared for him. Thus having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd ſuch powerful Friends, and reduced to his Obedience, a great part of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and Cities of <hi>Guienne,</hi> the <hi>Peregordins,</hi> and <hi>Bourdelois,</hi> thoſe of <hi>Tholouſe</hi> and <hi>Anjou,</hi> followed his Fortune.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Childebert,</hi> King of <hi>Mets,</hi> the Nephew of <hi>Gondoald,</hi> was then angry with his Uncle <hi>Gontran,</hi> King of <hi>Orleans,</hi> for refuſing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver into his hands, his Mother-in-Law, Queen <hi>Fredegonde,</hi> the Murthereſs of King <hi>Sigebert</hi> his Father; which reaſon perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to declare for <hi>Gondoald,</hi> ſending him Ambaſſadors, and ſtiling him <hi>King,</hi> to give him the more Majeſty, for the obtaining the Hearts of the <hi>French;</hi> adviſing him to take the Name of <hi>Clotaire,</hi> his Father. The oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of <hi>Gontrans</hi> refuſing to deliver to him the Queen <hi>Fredegonde,</hi> was, that young King <hi>Clotaire</hi> the Second, her Son, was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:98570:32"/>his Tutelage; and he thought it below a Generous Prince, to give up the Mother of him, whom he intended to make his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor. <hi>Gontran</hi> was a Prince extreamly Good, Pious, and Charitable: I can find no other Reaſon, why he preferr'd <hi>Clotaire</hi> his Nephew, who was but Four Months Old, when his Father <hi>Chilperic,</hi> was Aſſaſſinated, by the Infidelity of <hi>Fredegonde</hi> his Wife; <hi>Gondoald,</hi> having before ſo much cauſe to doubt whether <hi>Clotaire</hi> were Lawfully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got or no, his Mother being of a very ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Life, in her Husbands time, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning her ſelf to the Maire or Stewards of the Pallace, <hi>Londry de la Tour.</hi> Unleſs he thought the Deciſion of the Laws ſufficient, that <hi>Filius eſt quem nuptiae demonſtran;</hi> That Child is Legitimate who is Born of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who hath a Husband. He hoped to give good Impreſſions to the young Prince, being like ſoft Wax, capable of any he would make. But <hi>Gondoald's</hi> Humour he extreamly apprehended, for his fierceneſs, and reſentment of the uſage he received in his younger Days. That Divine Quality, ſo Admirable in a Prince, to forget Injuries received, when 'tis in his Power to Revenge them, never having been exerciſed by <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire</hi> his Father, who always prefer'd his own private Reſentments. This made him
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:98570:32"/>not acknowledge <hi>Gondoald,</hi> that came from the Court of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> when the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> Artifices, Treachery, and Cruelty, were much in uſe.</p>
               <p>The Affection, and tenderneſs he had for the Innocent Child, prevail'd over his aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Vices, and conduct of <hi>Fredegon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de</hi> his Mother. <hi>Raymond,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> a Perſon of an Exemplary Life, firſt ſpoke to the good King, in Favour of this young Prince; he having before, ſaved <hi>Fredegon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de</hi> from the Fury of the People, inraged by the Death of their King <hi>Chilperic;</hi> of which ſhe and her <hi>Gallant Landry,</hi> were ſhrewdly ſuſpected, he giving her with her Son, and Treaſure, refuge in his Church. The Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful King continued his Clemency to his Death, which happened the 28th. of <hi>March,</hi> 594. Still aſſiſting the Queen, with his Councel and Protection; He perſwaded her by his remonſtrances, with the fear and reſpect ſhe had to offend him, to Live a more retir'd Life; He cauſed what the Courtiers, and Domeſticks of his Brother <hi>Chilperic,</hi> had unjuſtly taken from ſeveral particular Perſons, to be reſtored; He did many Favours to the Church, making thoſe dues to be paid, which <hi>Chilperic</hi> had ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt, or diverted; and largly aſſiſting the Poor. All which he had reaſon to believe,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:98570:33"/>
                  <hi>Gondoald</hi> would not do, being greedy of Money, wanting all the Treaſure he could get to recompence his Creatures, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Luxury he had Learnt at <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople.</hi> I will not ſtop to relate the <hi>Encomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums,</hi> which <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Tours,</hi> and <hi>Fredega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> in their Chronicles give this King <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tran;</hi> only ſay, it was the greateſt misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, or if you pleaſe, an effect of Gods Judgment, to want his protection, and be rejected by him. Though <hi>Gondoald</hi> did all he could to obtain his Favour; He choſe two Prieſts of <hi>Cahors</hi> (as <hi>Guaguin</hi> Relates) of the moſt Pions he could find, hoping for that quality they would be well received, by his Brother King <hi>Gontran,</hi> he gave them his Letters, written on Tablets cover'd with Wax, and Directed to the chief Men of <hi>France.</hi> Theſe Prieſts were ſurprized by <hi>Gontrans</hi> People, who underſtood by the Contents, and the Confeſſion of the Bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, what <hi>Gondoalds</hi> Thoughts, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence intended.</p>
               <p>He left not off for this misfortune, but perſiſted in his indeavours, to gain the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Gontran;</hi> He ſent Ambaſſadors to him, carrying <hi>Olive</hi> Branches, that with the Symbole of Peace they might paſs eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, and get admittance; Being brought to his Preſence, after he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:98570:33"/>their Names and Country, they made this Speech.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We are come towards your Majeſty from</hi> Gondoald <hi>the Son of</hi> Clotaire, <hi>who with Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice demands a part of his Inheritance, which if your Majesty refuſe, he is reſolved to do him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Right by force of Arms: He has already a numerous Army in</hi> Guienne, <hi>and</hi> Childebert <hi>will joyn him with conſiderable Troops. Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tran</hi> was ſo diſpleaſed with their Diſcourſe, that he violated the Law of Nations, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniouſly uſing the Ambaſſadors, cauſing them to be tied with their Bellies to two Horſes, and whipt through the Streets. The Perſons of Ambaſſadors have always been Sacred, they came deſiring Peace, and carryed the Symbole of it. The Renowned <hi>Aeneas</hi> received the firſt marks of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Jamque Oratores aderant ex urbe Latina, Velati ramis Oliae.</q>
               <p>Antiquity allowed none but the Gods to uſe it, and their right devolved to Kings, who are their Images; for which reaſon, as a Note of Dignity it was called <hi>Jus Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</hi> The Injuries received by Ambaſſadors have ever been eſteemed done to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that ſent them; all Nations agreeing
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:98570:34"/>to Revenge a common injury. <hi>Si Civis Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatus actio eſt Injuriarum, ſi Magiſtratus Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatis, ſi Legatus bello &amp; Jure gentium agitur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is no wonder, after this Procedure of <hi>Gontrans,</hi> if they both made War with the extremity of violence. <hi>Paulus Aemilius,</hi> in an excellent Stile, writes of the diſmal Examples of Wars Domeſtick and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign; Civil Wars filling the minds of Men, with Diſtractions. But <hi>Gontran</hi> ſoon delivered his Subjects from thoſe Alarms, by adopting <hi>Childebert</hi> for his Heir, who was a Young Ambitious Prince, deſirous to augment his Dominion. The Good Old man had no Children Legitimate, nor na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, ſo choſe this way to make him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, in hopes of the Succeſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gontran</hi> called an Aſſembly, or <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> to Celebrate this Solemn Action, of Adopting his Nephew <hi>Childebert,</hi> the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſeperate his Intereſt from <hi>Gondoald.</hi> I can hardly believe what <hi>Guaguin,</hi> the ſame Author that writes the cruel affront done to <hi>Gondoalds</hi> Ambaſſadors, reports; which is, that he made them be brought into this Aſſembly, and ſhew their Commiſſions, as they had done to him already, where they owned and confirmed the Truth of a Report, had been diſcourſed before; which was, that <hi>Gondoald</hi> had robbed the Princeſs

                  <hi>Rigonde,</hi> Daughter of the Deceaſed King <hi>Chilperic,</hi> taking away her Money, and Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, as ſhe went to her new Husband in <hi>Spain:</hi> And that ſome of <hi>Childeberts</hi> Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers were in the Action, who abſconded from the Aſſembly on that Occaſion. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Gontran</hi> proceeded to effect what he intended, Adopting his Nephew <hi>Childebert,</hi> and uſing certain ceremonies, preſenting the point of a Lance to his Breaſt, giving him advice to make his Kingdom Flouriſh, and at the ſame time, Reſtoring thoſe Towns and Places, his Uncle <hi>Chilperic</hi> had taken from him.</p>
               <p>The Allies of <hi>Gondoald, Didier, Momol, Landaſe, Valden,</hi> and <hi>Sagittaire</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Gap,</hi> a Turbulent Man, who had been Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht from his Dioceſs, being Informed of the Agreement between the Uncle and the Nephew, and knowing that by this Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he would quit the Intereſt of <hi>Gondoald,</hi> reſolved all to do ſo at the ſame time; Yet his unhappineſs made him not looſe Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, he retired to <hi>Comminges</hi> beyond the River of <hi>Dordogne,</hi> careſſing the Citizens, Living Familiarly with them, and making great Proteſtations of Friendſhip, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded them to carry all their Riches into the Caſtle, for fear of looſing them, if the Town were Beſieged, but the Caſtle he
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:98570:35"/>eſteemed Impregnable. Sometime after, making them believe that the Enemy was near; he cauſed them to take Arms, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Gates, and incouraging them to make a Sally; but as ſoon as they were gone, he ſhut them out, driving their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop after them, becauſe he was of the contrary Party. The Lords, of whom we ſpoke, ſtill kept fair with him, though they intended to leave him, they had not yet broken all meaſures.</p>

It was a ſtrange overſight to truſt a Woman, and of ſo ill Fame. However he ſent his Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, with his Money and other Treaſure to <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi> But the Men whom <hi>Gontran</hi> had laid in Ambuſh beyond the River <hi>Gironde,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Landegeſille,</hi> General of <hi>Gontrans</hi> Army, Invented a ſort of Chariots covered with large Oziers, which defended thoſe that dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>Mines,</hi> for the better taking the Town; they alſo cut down great quantities of Wood in the Forreſt there abouts, and endeavoured to fill the Ditch. The Beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the other ſide, with Boats, great Stones, Pitch, and Firebrands, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to burn the Wood, and hurt the Beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Theſe attacks taking ſmall effect, <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degeſille</hi> Tryed another way to accompliſh his Deſigne, he deſired to ſpeak with <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mol,</hi> and giving him a Friendly reproof, for quitting the Service, and intereſts of King <hi>Gontran,</hi> to aſſiſt <hi>Gondoald,</hi> aſſured him if he would cauſe the Town to fall into the Power of the King his Maſter, he would for certain liberally acknowledge that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and pardon all that was paſt. <hi>Momol</hi> deſired time to conſider this Propoſal, and declared it to the Biſhop <hi>Sagittaire, Landaſe,</hi> and <hi>Valden</hi> his intimate Friends, ſhewing them the eminent danger they were in, if the place ſhould fall by force into the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>Gontran,</hi> and that therefore they ought to think of their ſafety. They all
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:98570:36"/>gave attention to <hi>Momol's</hi> advice, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it; Reſolving to fire a Church, and while the People ſhould run to quench it, take that opportunity to deliver one of the Gates, and receive <hi>Landegeſille</hi> into the Town. They made <hi>Carulfe</hi> their confident, who was one of the richeſt Citizens there, and their Landlord. After this Reſolution taken, and the Day pitched upon, on which the Church was to be burnt, and the Town to be delivered to <hi>Landegeſille; Momol</hi> went privately to <hi>Landegeſille,</hi> and ſhewed him the places where his Men ſhould enter, provided he kept his word, and promiſe with him, and obtained him the Kings Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. <hi>Landegeſille</hi> overjoyed to take ſo ſtrong a place, and ſave the effuſion of more Blood, confirmed all he had ſaid with an Oath, and that at leaſt if he could not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately gain the Kings Pardon, he would, in the mean time, procure him a Church for his refuge, till he had compaſſed his Mercy. Things being thus agreed, <hi>Momol</hi> changed his Intention of burning the Church, and went to <hi>Gondoald</hi> with great deceit, and artifice, aſſuring him that his Fidelity, and zeal to ſerve him, were not in any ſort diminiſhed; which obliged him to repreſent, the deploreable Condition his affairs were reduced to, from which he
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:98570:36"/>could conjecture no hope; That this had perſwaded him to ſound the Inclination of <hi>Landegeſille,</hi> whom he found extreamly well diſpoſed to ſerve him, and to indeavour a good Peace between him and King <hi>Gontran,</hi> his Brother; That nothing ſhockt him more, than to perceive he had not that Truſt and Conſidence he deſired, in the Tenderneſs and Generoſity of the King, and that if he could have ſo good an Opinion, without difficulty to meet <hi>Landegeſille,</hi> he did not doubt to give him all ſatisfaction Imaginable; <hi>And,</hi> continued he, <hi>'Tis my Opinion, that you ſhould deliver your ſelf from all theſe Miſeries and troubles, and let us go together to King Gontran. Gondoald</hi> diſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Fraudulent Diſcourſe of <hi>Momol,</hi> yet ſo great was his Unhappineſs, he did not give himſelf Power to help it, believing it impoſſible, to avoid the Malice and Treaſon of thoſe Perſons, he had ſo long truſted and confided in.</p>
               <p>While theſe things were agitating; <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſe,</hi> one of the Conſpirators againſt the unhappy <hi>Gondoald,</hi> put Fire to the Church, and while the People ran to quench it, went ſecretly out of Town where <hi>Bolo,</hi> and <hi>Bolon,</hi> Count of <hi>Bourges,</hi> ſtood ready with their Men before the Gates, to ſeize <hi>Gondo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ald,</hi> as ſoon as he ſhould be delivered to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:98570:37"/>them; which <hi>Momol,</hi> being the ſtronger Man, did not fail to do, &amp; gave the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Gondoald</hi> into his Power, he re-entring the Town immediately, and cauſing the Gates to be ſhut. The Priſoner, <hi>Gondoald,</hi> was abuſed by the Souldiers that Guarded him, who carryed him to a Deſcent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Town, and the Camp of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegers. <hi>Belon,</hi> one of the Generals, tumbled him down the Hill, and <hi>Boſon</hi> barbarouſly knockt out his Brains, as he rowled to his Feet. So dyed this Unhappy Prince, or this bold Impoſtor, who perſiſted to mount the Throne of <hi>France,</hi> in ſpight of thoſe who had Power to grant him that Advantage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Momol</hi> did not proſper in his Treaſon and Avarice; for while he plundred the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page and Mony of <hi>Gondoald,</hi> pillaged and fined the Citizens; the Souldiers of the Army, inraged at their loſſes before the Town, through the long and vigorous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the Inhabitants, forced the Gates, and put all to Fire and Sword, without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Age or Sex. The Walls were razed, and the City intirely Burnt. <hi>Momol</hi> thinking he had done great Service by his Conduct, came to the General <hi>Lendege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſille</hi> his Quarter; who commanded him to go out of his Tent, and retire ſome where elſe, till the Souldiers rage againſt his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:98570:37"/>was appeaſed: He perceived, if he went out, he ſhould dye, the incenſed <hi>Souldiers</hi> flock't about him, giving him revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Language; therefore he reſolved to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himſelf ſo long as he was able, and ſell his Life dearly. The General being through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Informed of the Kings Pleaſure, who commanded that he ſhould have no Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, made a Signe for the Souldiers to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch him: <hi>Momol</hi> valiantly defending him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a great while, Fought like a Lyon; but could not avoid falling under ſuch a Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, all covered with wounds; ſo recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the reward of his double Treaſons. And for the Biſhop <hi>Sagittaire,</hi> a Souldier perceiving him Fly, cut off his Head with his Sword, not knowing who he was. The Riches <hi>Momol</hi> had gotten, were carried to <hi>Gontran,</hi> where he found a Thouſand Pound weight of Gold, in that Coyn which they called <hi>Beſans,</hi> and 250 Pound of Silver. <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tran</hi> giving a good part of it to the Poor, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the reſt, with his Nephew <hi>Childebert.</hi> Among the Spoyls of <hi>Momol,</hi> there was led a Gyant three foot higher than ordinary Men, as <hi>Robert Guaguin,</hi> from whom I have taken great part of this Story, ſays.

               <p>THis <hi>Impoſtor</hi> pretended to no leſs than the Empire of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> with the Earldoms of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and <hi>Haynault.</hi> Zeal for the Chriſtian Religion, and a Deſire to drive the Infidels out of the <hi>Holy-Land,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded many generous Princes of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to forſake their Countrys, and expoſe their Lives in this Enterprize. Of which Number was <hi>Theobald,</hi> Count <hi>Palatin</hi> of <hi>Champagne,</hi> (who dyed by the way); <hi>Bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyn,</hi> Earl of <hi>Flanders; Boniface,</hi> Marquis of <hi>Mount-ferrat; Lewis,</hi> Earl of <hi>Blois; John,</hi> Earl of <hi>Brienne,</hi> and <hi>Guy</hi> Earl of St. <hi>Paul;</hi> with the Biſhops of <hi>Soiſſons</hi> and <hi>Troys.</hi> Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the <hi>Third,</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>Signia,</hi> ſhow'ring his Indulgences, and Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on their deſign.</p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:98570:38"/>
               <p>In the beginning of this War, (which was in the Year, 1203.) a Young <hi>Grecian</hi> Prince, of 23 years of Age, called <hi>Alexis,</hi> Implor'd the Aſſiſtance of theſe Chriſtian <hi>Argonautes,</hi> while they were Beſieging the City <hi>Zara,</hi> in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> which the <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> poſſeſt, and they undertook in lieu of their expences at <hi>Venice,</hi> before their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture. <hi>Iſaac Angelo,</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenes,</hi> Emperor of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> was the Father of this Prince <hi>Alexis,</hi> and Father-in-Law to <hi>Philip,</hi> Emperor of <hi>Germany,</hi> by his Daughter <hi>Irene.</hi> He was depoſed from his <hi>Empire,</hi> deprived of his Sight &amp; Liberty, by his only, (though unnatural, and ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful) Brother <hi>Alexis;</hi> to whom he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſhewn the Marks of a more than Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly kindneſs. After the taking of <hi>Zara,</hi> reſtor'd through the Valour of the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, to the Obedience of St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Lyon; the Generous Warriors embarkt on 250 Ships, in which were 20000 Foot, and 8000 Horſe. <hi>Henry Danduli,</hi> the <hi>Doge</hi> or Duke of <hi>Venice,</hi> though almoſt blinded by the cruelty of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Emperor <hi>Emanu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el Commenes,</hi> who cauſed a burning Plate of Copper to be held to his Eyes, went in the Head of many Noble <hi>Venetians,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by the ſame Zeal, which made them equip a Fleet for this Expedition.</p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:98570:39"/>
               <p>They drove the Uſurper <hi>Alexis</hi> from <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> taking the old Emperor <hi>Iſaac</hi> out of Priſon, and Eſtabliſhing him with his Son, the young <hi>Alexis</hi> in the Throne. But the old Prince died in a few Days, not being able to ſuffer ſo great a change of Life and Fortune, without a mortal Alteration of his Body, thro' exceſs of Joy, for ſo unexpected a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity. A Villain called alſo <hi>Alexis Ducas,</hi> ſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named <hi>Murzuphle,</hi> from his large ſpread eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brows, ſuddenly ſeiz'd the Perſon of young <hi>Alexis;</hi> and, after having twice made him ſwallow Poyſon without effect, ſtrangled him with his own hands; reporting he had deſtroy'd himſelf; when he had Reign'd Six Months, and Eight Days. The <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Venetian</hi> Army, by Land and Sea, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the Neighbourhood, expecting the effect of young <hi>Alexis</hi> Promiſes; which he not being able to perform in the time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on, too earneſtly endeavouring to raiſe the Money, fell into the hatred of the People, and was thus deprived of his Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem and Life. So bloody a Regicide, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the Chaſtiſement our Warriours in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended him; who, drawing their Army down, Beſieged <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> for 72 Days. <hi>Geofry de Vilhardouin,</hi> writ the Story of this Siege, and the particular Actions of the <hi>Heroes. Murzuphle</hi> fled with his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:98570:39"/>abandoning the City, which was taken the 12th. of <hi>April,</hi> 1204.</p>
               <p>The Princes, and other Lords, reſolved to chooſe an Emperor amongſt them: The Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> with the <hi>Count of St. Paul,</hi> named <hi>Five,</hi> to give their Suffrages: The <hi>Marquis</hi> of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,</hi> other five: The <hi>Venetians</hi> chooſing the like Number: In all, 15 Voyces. The Plurality were for <hi>Baldwyn.</hi> This Prince was very powerful, and a Great Souldier; of which he had given many Proofs, in the Siege: He was Uncle, by the Mothers Side, to <hi>Lewis,</hi> deſign'd Succeſſor to <hi>Philip the Auguſt,</hi> King of <hi>France.</hi> He was Crown'd by <hi>Thomaſo Moroſini,</hi> newly created Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch of <hi>Conſtantinople. Boniface,</hi> Marquis of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> had from young <hi>Alexis,</hi> for a Recompence, the Iſland of <hi>Candia;</hi> which he ſold the <hi>Venetians,</hi> for a great Sum of Money, and was nevertheleſs made King of <hi>Theſſaly. Godfry,</hi> Lord of <hi>Champagn,</hi> was made Duke of <hi>Athens,</hi> and Prince of <hi>Achaia; John,</hi> Earl of <hi>Brienne,</hi> was ſometime after made King of <hi>Jeruſalem. Baldwin</hi> had ſcarcely poſſeſt this new Dignity a Year, before he went to Beſiege <hi>Adrianople,</hi> three Days Journey from him, and poſſeſt by his Enemies, who very much annoyed him. That Succeſs he had in the beginning, did
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:98570:40"/>not accompany him in this Affair; ſince by the profound Secrets of the Divine Pleaſure, being attackt with great Numbers of his Adverſaries, <hi>Greek</hi> Fugitives, <hi>Bulgarians,</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> he was defeated, and ſuppoſed to be kill'd in the Plaines of <hi>Oreſtes. A noſtris pro Mortuo deploratus eſt,</hi> ſays <hi>Paulus Aemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius;</hi> His Brother <hi>Henry</hi> Succeeding him in the Empire. This Diſaſter happened in the Year 1205, though ſome Chronologiſts an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidate it, two or three Years.</p>
               <p>Twenty Years after, This Famous <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor,</hi> calling himſelf by the Name of this Emperour, appeared in <hi>Flanders: Jane,</hi> el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Daughter of this <hi>Baldwin,</hi> by <hi>Mary,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Champagne,</hi> was at that time Counteſs of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and Married to <hi>Fernando,</hi> Infant of <hi>Portugal.</hi> She had great Wars, her Husband having been taken Priſoner, at the Famous Battle of <hi>Bovines,</hi> which King <hi>Philip the Auguſt,</hi> gained over the Emperour <hi>Otho</hi> the 4th, in year 1214. And was long a Priſoner in the <hi>Louvre</hi> at <hi>Paris.</hi> Although this had been ſome Years paſt, ſhe ſtill felt her loſſes, and that great Conſternation. <hi>Robert</hi> Son of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter de Courtenay,</hi> Earl of <hi>Auxerre,</hi> and Prince of the Blood of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Yolente</hi> only Daughter and Inheritrix of the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> then poſſeſt that
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:98570:40"/>Throne, to which this <hi>Impoſtor</hi> pertended.</p>
               <p>One would have thought, he ſhould firſt have gone to the place, where he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Priſoner; but he could hope no aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from the <hi>Greeks:</hi> On the contrary <hi>Theodore Laſcaris,</hi> who reſided at <hi>Nice,</hi> and always took upon himſelf the Title of <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of Conſtantinople,</hi> would have uſed him worſe than the <hi>Bulgarians,</hi> if he had fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into his hands. As for <hi>Robert de Courtnay,</hi> whoſe Mother <hi>Yolente,</hi> was his pretended Niece; he was no ways inclin'd to yield him the Empire; he had too much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in obtaining it. His Father, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Peter,</hi> falling into the Hands of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odore,</hi> was cruelly put to Death by him: So that, this <hi>Impoſtor</hi> thought his Affairs would advance better, and he be more kindly received in his Native Country. The Earldome of <hi>Haynault</hi> was his firſt Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; for this <hi>Baldwin,</hi> was Son to an Earl of <hi>Haynault,</hi> of the ſame Name, Sirnamed <hi>The Magnanimous,</hi> and of <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſace,</hi> Heireſs of <hi>Flanders.</hi> For this Reaſon he was Joyfully received there, and with more ſatisfaction to thoſe Martial People, who hated the Dominion of a Woman: Beſides, it was Independant on the Kings of <hi>France.</hi> The <hi>Flemings</hi> received him very coldly, ſeeing but a ſmall Train with him, nor
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:98570:41"/>would they own him for their Earl, or Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of <hi>Greece.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Impoſtor</hi> affected an extraordinary Gravity in his Meine, the better to draw Veneration, and acquire the Majeſty of an Emperour. The Counteſs <hi>Jane</hi> refuſed to ſee him; but was adviſed to interrogate him, for the better diſcovery of his Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. The Preſident of her Councel of State, ſummon'd him to appear, ask'd him many troubleſome Queſtions, <hi>Gravibus fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigare percontationibus auſus eſt;</hi> and ſpoke to him in this manner:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If it be true, that you are the Earl</hi> Bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win, <hi>and aſſume not a Falſe Title to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of</hi> Greece; <hi>I demand of you, Why you have abandon'd your Subjects in that Country? Even thoſe poor People, laden with Miſeries, whom the Divine Providence, by the Suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of ſo many brave Men, had committed to your Protection? Why forſake you them in their greateſt need of your Conduct and Care; having ſo many Generous, and Experienc'd Captains, to whom you owed the laſt and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Obligations, for chuſing you among the moſt principal Men in the World, to be their Chief, and ſet the Imperial Diadem upon your Head? Why have you thus neglected them, expoſed to the rage of Barbarous Nations? For this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, although you were the true</hi> Baldwin,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:98570:41"/>
                  <hi>we have ſufficient Cauſe to diſſemble our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of you; ſure then we ſhall not own you, who are but a falſe and a counterfeit</hi> Badlwin. <hi>Why, when the Affairs of all the</hi> Eaſt <hi>were laid on your ſhoulders, to be ſupported, and ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by you; when they were in diſorder, and loſt by your misfortune, have you feign'd to be dead, and conceal'd your being alive? What could you expect from ſo ſtrange a Deceit? Or what could be the reaſon of ſuch a ſuppoſition and impoſture? If you would ſo long dwell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Dead, why ſhould we now believe you are alive, not having appear'd in any place theſe twenty years? And had you been what you pretend now, why did you not come in the time of</hi> Philip <hi>the</hi> Auguſt, <hi>your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Law, (who Married</hi> Alix, <hi>one of your Siſters) and in the life time of ſo many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Honour, who might either have proved your Impoſture, or authorized your Title? Why came you not ſooner out of the Grave? In what darkneſs have you hid that Glorious Face, known to the whole World? And with what new one do you pretend to Enchant the eyes of Men, after ſo many years? I ask, if you believe your ſelf, that we ought to give faith to a Man, who after ſo vaſt an Interval, ſhall ſay,</hi> I am the Emperor <hi>Baldwyn. Have we never ſeen nor heard, that there have been Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors, who have falſly <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpt the Quality

               </p>
               <p>This Man heard, with attention, theſe Remonſtrances, ſhewing a great aſſurance and courage, ſpeaking in his turn; but not as if he would anſwer theſe Reproaches, but reprove and condemn them; diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling by this procedure, his boldneſs and grandure of mind: And told them <q>That his Country-men and Subjects were more Inhumane than his Enemies; that Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before <hi>Adrianople,</hi> for the glory of that Country, which now diſown'd him, being over-power'd, and made Priſoner by the unequal number of his Enemies, as often arrives in the chance and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of War; yet notwithſtanding he had not ſuffer'd ſo much Contempt, nor ſo extraordinary Opprobry, either by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Majeſty of his Perſon and Name, or elſe in conſideration of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in <hi>Flanders,</hi> but was kept and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:98570:43"/>moderately; till by length of time, his Guards were not ſo ſtrict, but he found an opportunity to ſave himſelf, by the extraordinary favour of Heaven: And that returning to his Country, he had been retaken by other Barbarians, who did not know him, nor to whom he did not diſcover himſelf; they carryed him into <hi>Aſia,</hi> and uſed him like a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Slave; ſold him to the <hi>Syrians,</hi> where he dwelt two years in a Barn, with other Captives, ſometimes driving the Plow, and breaking the Clods of Earth with thoſe hands with which he had held the Scepter; till during a Truce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and the <hi>Barbarians</hi> of <hi>Aſia,</hi> ſome <hi>German</hi> Merchants Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling by the place where he was at work, he ſpoke to them in the <hi>German</hi> Tongue, and made himſelf known to them, telling them his unhappy and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Adventures; who bought him at a common price: And that now after this good fortune, his own Subjects af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted him, ſo as neither the <hi>Greeks</hi> nor the Inhabitants of <hi>Thrace,</hi> their cruel Neighbours the <hi>Scythians,</hi> nor the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians</hi> of <hi>Syria,</hi> had ever uſed him. As to <hi>Flanders</hi> it was never more happy, nor more flouriſhing, than when he poſſeſt
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:98570:44"/>the dignity of Earl. Their glory had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been greater at home nor abroad, than when they own'd him for their Prince. He always ſtil'd himſelf <hi>Auguſt, Choſen or Elect of God,</hi> and uſed a Seal of maſſive Gold. He termed them ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Subjects, and Country-men, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach him with provoking queſtions, after having ſuffer'd ſo many Vexations and Miſeries: Surely they had changed their Inclination, and degenerated from the Virtue and Juſtice of their Fathers, by whom he was made Sovereign and Emperor of <hi>Greece,</hi> and had made and given Laws to all the People of the Eaſt. But he wondred not that <hi>Flanders</hi> had fallen into all theſe diſorders, and had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the good and commendable qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of their Fathers, to embrace thoſe which were new and pernicious; that on the contrary, in his Government, they were extraordinary flouriſhing.</q> He would have continued ſpeaking much longer, and made them greater Reproaches, if the Lord Treaſurer, who was alſo Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the Counſel, had not broke it up; ſaying, It was not fit for them to conclude any thing in Affairs of that Importance, without knowing the good pleaſure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of their Counteſs. This Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:98570:44"/>had an extream averſion to this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender, whether it might not be becauſe ſhe really thought <hi>Baldwyn</hi> her Father was dead; but ſhe effectively ſent into <hi>Greece, John</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Mutelan,</hi> (that, without doubt, which is now called the Iſle of <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telene</hi>) and <hi>Albert,</hi> a Religious man of the Order of St. <hi>Bennet,</hi> both of the <hi>Greek</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to enquire and inform themſelves, if <hi>Baldwyn</hi> were dead or alive: The <hi>Annals,</hi> or <hi>Hiſtories</hi> of <hi>Flanders,</hi> written by <hi>Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Meyer, Adrianus Barlandus,</hi> and others, which furniſh me with the greateſt part of this Story, obſerve; That it was not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly known, whether in the unhappy Battel of <hi>Adrianople</hi> he was kill'd or taken, only that he could not be found; but theſe two Envoys were upon the place, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Arrived in <hi>Bulgaria,</hi> they made ſo exact an enquiry, that they were inform'd of his being taken by <hi>John,</hi> King of that Country, and was by his order carryed to the Queen his Wife, to the Town of <hi>Cernoa;</hi> who following the nature of an inrag'd <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi> cruelly put him to death, chopping his Limbs to pieces, and throwing them to the Fowls of the air. <hi>Meyer</hi> writes theſe circumſtances in the 8th.

               <p>Beſides ſhe that had been accuſtomed to command, and had long been Miſtreſs, muſt needs think with much grief, of delivering the Sovereign Power to another, of which ſhe had ſo long thought ſhe ſhould never be deprived, but by Death. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this, a great part of the Flemiſh Nobility received this Man for their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, and Emperor of the Eaſt, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his Obedience; and the more readily by his ſubtilty in Authorizing their Cognizance of him, and the Veneration they had to his Perſon, by his telling them their Names and Extractions, which he readily did to a great part of the Nobility of <hi>Flanders,</hi> with the glorious Actions of their Anceſtors; ſhewing their Arms, Blaſons, and Devices of their Families, and all their Genealogies. He underſtood the Countrey very well, having lived ſeveral years a Hermit in the Forreſt of <hi>Glaucone,</hi> near <hi>Valenciennes.</hi> He appeared in a ſtrange habit, like the <hi>Armenians,</hi> wearing a great rufled beard. The common People, who being Ignorant, and love Novelty, believed his Impoſtures; and the rather, for his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſame Stature, and having ſeverall features, like the true <hi>Baldwyn.</hi> He found himſelf ſo well aſſiſted, that he deſigned to ſeize the Counteſs <hi>Jane,</hi> and wanted very
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:98570:45"/>little of ſurprizing her in <hi>Quenoy;</hi> but ſhe was fled to a ſtrong Caſtle, and had ſent Ambaſſadors to <hi>Lewis</hi> the 8th. King of <hi>France</hi> for aſſiſtance. The Hiſtorian <hi>Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guin</hi> (who was a Subject of this Princeſs, and born at <hi>Preaven</hi> near <hi>Caſſel,</hi> and gives her the Character of a very Wiſe Princeſs) ſays, ſhe came in Perſon to the King for ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, againſt the Inſolence of this unknown Impoſtor, intreating his Favor and Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in this Conjuncture, as Soveraign of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and ſhe one of the Nobles Feuda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of the Crown of <hi>France;</hi> to which ſhe was ſo nearly related. The King came as far as <hi>Campagne,</hi> where he appointed the Impoſtor to meet him, who came extraordinarily accompanied: He was Cloath'd in Scarlet, having a white ſtaffe in his hand: When he was Introduced to the King, he ſaluted him very ſlightingly; to whom the King ſaid; <hi>I know not in what manner I ſhould Salute you, nor what Title to give you:</hi> Baldwin, <hi>Earl of</hi> Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <hi>and</hi> Haynault, <hi>was my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle, and a moſt Generous Prince; He was alſo Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of</hi> Greece: <hi>Whoſe Death I have lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when I was in my Youth.

But I cannot lightly be perſwaded, from the belief I have of his death, and the report which hath been confirmed, through the courſe of ſo many Years: Moſt humane things, eſpecially Empires, ſubſiſt by the Teſtimony of men.

The Cruelty of <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> Son of <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and Brother of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth King of <hi>England,</hi> gave <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Richmond,</hi> Grand-ſon of <hi>Owen Tudor,</hi> and <hi>Catharine of France,</hi> a Pretenſion to Arm a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, for the Recovery of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>England,</hi> which <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, before Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and Head of the <hi>Red-Roſe,</hi> had uſurp't from <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth.

                  <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> had alſo uſurp't the Crown from <hi>Edward</hi> the Fifth, a young Prince of Twelve years old, Eldeſt Son and Succeſſor to King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth; as likewiſe from his Brother <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> his two Nephews, whom he unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and cruelly murthered in the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> in the year 1483.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Margaret,</hi> Siſter to King <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Fourth,</hi> Widow of <hi>Charles the Hardy,</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and Soveraign of the <hi>Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Provinces</hi> of the <hi>Lower Germany,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and inſtructed this Counterfeit, to take the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> (if ſhe could have effected, what ſhe had often endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured) from <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Seventh,</hi> Chief of the Houſe of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> or the <hi>White-Roſe,</hi> whom ſhe mortally hated. This is the Truth of the Story, as <hi>Polydore Virgil,</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoriographer to <hi>Henry the Eighth,</hi> relates
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:98570:49"/>it, in the <hi>Twenty-ſixth</hi> Book of his Hiſtory of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Princeſs, (a Woman of an Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Intriguing humour) had conceived a great Averſion to <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminator of the Uſurper <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Gloceſter.</hi> The principal cauſe of her Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred proceeded from the long Enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Family of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and her's of the Houſe of <hi>York;</hi> which made her conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually endeavour, by all means imaginable, his extirpation, with the ſatisfaction of her own Revenge, in the removal of the Crown to One of her own Party: But finding all her endeavours miſcarried, and thoſe of <hi>John</hi> Earl of <hi>Lincoln</hi> were come to nothing, her old Inveterate temper prompted her with new Expedients, more difficult for <hi>Henry</hi> to prevent.</p>
               <p>She met a young man at <hi>Tourney,</hi> who was handſom, of a ſubtle with and quick Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, his name was <hi>Peter Warbeck,</hi> but the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in Deriſion, after called him <hi>Perkin.</hi> He underſtood <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and ſome other Languages, was very little known, being of the meaneſt Birth, and in extream Poverty. He had Travel'd through divers Countrys like a Beggar and a Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond. Him, the Dutcheſs <hi>Margaret,</hi> thought a ſit Inſtrument, to Counterfeit the Duke
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:98570:49"/>of <hi>York,</hi> ſecond Son of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth. She hid him in her Houſe, and inſtructed him in the affairs of <hi>England,</hi> and the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Intereſts of the Houſe of <hi>York,</hi> till he perfectly underſtood his buſineſs; Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printing her Maxims in his memory, and talking properly of them, perſuading all that he was the Real Prince of that Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Family. Perſons of that Quality and Birth have an Inſtinct not to be deſcribed, to follow the ſteps of their Glorious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, that they may deſerve the ſame admiration, and even in this ſhe had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him. And now ſhe, underſtanding that King <hi>Henry</hi> was raiſing Men for <hi>France,</hi> to aſſiſt <hi>Francis</hi> Duke of <hi>Brittain,</hi> (his old Benefactor) believing this a favourable oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſet her Engins at work, and cauſe a diſturbance in <hi>England,</hi> ſhe ſent <hi>Perkin</hi> privately into <hi>Ireland,</hi> that ſo this young and well-inſtructed Adventurer, might ſow the Seeds of Rebellion amongſt thoſe unciviliz'd People, who were always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to Mutiny.</p>
               <p>When he Landed in <hi>Ireland,</hi> he ſo well imploy'd his time and favour there, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the principal <hi>Iriſh</hi> believed his deceit, and gave him the ſame Honour, as if he had really been what he pretended, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to Arm, and follow him with all Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries for the War.</p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:98570:50"/>
               <p>This News being ſpread abroad, <hi>Francis,</hi> the Eighth King of <hi>France,</hi> invited him to his Court, that he might oppoſe him to <hi>Henry</hi> his declared Enemy, who was then ready to Land in <hi>France. Perkin</hi> overjoy'd at this News, believing himſelf Bleſt, to enter into the Familiarity of Kings, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed the Sea, and came to the <hi>French</hi> Court, where he was Magnificently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and had a Train of Guards appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him: But ſuddenly after, a Peace was concluded between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> and the King finding him no longer uſeful for his Purpoſe, diſmiſt him the Court. Being thus diſappointed of his hopes, he went to the Dutcheſs Dowager, into <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Princeſs longed to know how he had been Received and Entertained, but the diſappointment ſenſibly afflicted her; yet ſhe Treated him, as if ſhe had never ſeen him before; which ſhe cunningly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to perſuade, being overjoy'd to ſee him; publickly Congratulating his happy return, and taking a ſingular plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to hear him tell, how nearly he eſcaped in ſeveral Countrys, which he Travell'd. This ſhe did, the better to perſuade the World, he was the true Son of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, her Brother; and ſhew'd him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:98570:50"/>Reſpect, as likewiſe did the <hi>Flemiſh</hi> Lords on her account. The Deceit being hid under ſo much appearance of Truth, as perſuaded them that he eſcap'd death by the particular Providence of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and when he was in the Power of his Uncle <hi>Richard,</hi> a faithful Servant of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had convey'd him privately beyond Sea, ſo Reſcuing him out of his cruel hands, and that now he would attempt to regain the Kingdom of his Anceſtors. The Story of ſo ſtrange an Adventure was ſoon ſpread over all the Country, flying into <hi>England,</hi> where it paſt for Truth, not only among the common People, but even with ſeveral of the Nobility.</p>
               <p>When the News came that <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York</hi> was alive, the number of the Seditious increas'd abundantly. They, whoſe Crimes or Debts made them ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcond, or whoſe Poverty hoped advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, fled into <hi>Flanders</hi> to <hi>Perkin;</hi> and ſoon after, many of the moſt conſiderable Lords entred into the Conſpiracy, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the Impoſtor; ſwayed by their own raſhneſs, or by a falſe perſuaſion that this young Man was Prince <hi>Richard,</hi> Son of King <hi>Edward,</hi> and having a blind affection for the Houſe of <hi>York;</hi> Others through Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, believing themſelves ill rewarded by
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:98570:51"/>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, whom they had ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured their Lives for, to ſet him upon the Throne: Many through Avarice, and a deſire of change, were driven into this Conſpiracy. Thus the News of <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Yorks</hi> being alive, divided <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Hopes and Fears filled the minds of all men, none were exempted from Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, each meaſuring his Danger or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage according to his Intereſt, Fancy, and particular Opinion.</p>
               <p>It was an extraordinary aſtoniſhment, to the King, and his Friends, that there ſhould be any Man in the World, who had the Impudence to invent and diſcourſe ſo Pernicious an Impoſture; which was not only improbable, but lookt impoſſible; and under the colour of Truth, concealed a moſt Subtle and Implacable piece of Malice, which he already knew many great Men in the Kingdom had a mind to give Credit to, (though he diſſembled his Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:) And he foreſaw this Fable might indanger the Ruin of the State, if it were not early diſcovered to the Nation, for no other than a fictitious, moſt wicked, and dangerous Counterfeit.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who delighted in War and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, embrac'd theſe Novelties, perſuading themſelves there was no deceit in them,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:98570:51"/>and that the News was all true; believing they ſhould reap both Honour and Profit, by Fomenting the Hopes of their Party: And this being a Point of ſo much Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, the Conſpirators ſent into <hi>Flanders</hi> to the Dutcheſs Dowager, to know of her, when ſhe thought fit that <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York</hi> ſhould paſs over into <hi>England,</hi> that they might the ſooner Advertiſe their Friends, and have them ready to give him all neceſſary Aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Robert Clifford,</hi> and <hi>William Barklay,</hi> were deputed for this, by the general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the reſt; They gave the Dutcheſs <hi>Margaret</hi> an account what the Creatures and Favourers of this New Duke had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to do, which gave her an extream pleaſure: She aſſured them, all that had been advantagiouſly diſcourſed of <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> was really ſo, ſhewing them the <hi>Impoſtor,</hi> who Counterfeited the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Richard</hi> to a wonder: Then ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll'd his Vertues to the Skies, and made admirable Report of his Princely Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which were to imitate the Actions of his glorious Anceſtors. When <hi>Clifford</hi> had ſeen the Youth, he really believed him of the Blood Royal, and ſo writ to his Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondents in <hi>England:</hi> And the better to make himſelf be believed, he aſſured them,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:98570:52"/>he perfectly remembred his Face. After the delivery of theſe Letters, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived a new Motive, to excite the People to favour their Party: They aſſured them nothing could be more True, than the News of <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York;</hi> and this they ſo cunningly ſpread, that no Author could be produced for the Report.</p>
               <p>The King perceiving theſe Deceits, not to diminiſh in the Peoples minds, thought himſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For the better diſabuſing the <hi>Engliſh</hi> from their falſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; he ſent his ſubtleſt Spies through all the Towns of <hi>Flanders,</hi> to underſtand the Birth and Original of this Counterfeit, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing large Recompence to thoſe that could diſcover it; Writing to his Friends on the ſame Subject. Theſe Emiſſaries exactly obeyed their Orders, ſome of them coming to <hi>Tournay,</hi> found the falſe <hi>Richard</hi> was Born there, of the Meaneſt of the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:98570:52"/>People, his name being <hi>Peter Warbeck,</hi> of which they brought very authentick At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations.</p>
               <p>Upon this the King ſent a ſolemn Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſy to young Earl <hi>Philip</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> of which Sir <hi>Edward Poinings,</hi> and <hi>William Warham,</hi> Dr. of Laws, were chief: The latter of theſe was alſo a Church-man, of extraordinary Parts and Modeſty: He made a Speech to the Lords of the Young Princes Counſel, who was not of Age yet to take the Government upon himſelf. <hi>He laid the impiouſneſs of the Impoſtor before them, putting them in mind of the like hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening in their Country, about</hi> 250 <hi>years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in the time of their Counteſs</hi> Jane: <hi>Likewiſe telling them, that the Effects of the King his Maſters Friendſhip, to</hi> Maximilian, <hi>Father of the Prince, in the War of</hi> France, <hi>ſhould not be ſo quickly blotted out of their memory; ſharply reflecting on the Conduct of the Dutcheſs</hi> Margaret, <hi>who brought forth in her elder Years, not a Child at nine Months, but a Prodigy of nine ſcore Months old.</hi> The Councel, after a long Debate, reply'd, <hi>That to gratifie the King, their Earl would give no aſſiſtance to</hi> Perkin: <hi>But for the Dutcheſs Dowager, She was Miſtreſs of her Joynture, and her Actions; and they would neither preſcribe, nor forbid her any thing.</hi> The
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:98570:53"/>Ambaſſadors being return'd, <hi>Henry</hi> ſent divers Emiſſaries; ſome to diſcover the Names of the Conſpirators, by feigning to enter into the deſign; others to endeavour the perſuading Sir <hi>Robert Clifford,</hi> and <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Barklay</hi> to return, with the aſſurance of their Pardon. <hi>Clifford</hi> was prevailed on; but <hi>Barklay</hi> continued obſtinate, not returning till two Years after, and till he was certain of the Kings Mercy. Some of the Kings Meſſengers came back, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving diſcovered many of the Conſpirators: Others ſtaid longer, to accompany <hi>Clifford,</hi> whoſe coming home, ſo much diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced the Plotters, that they knew not whom to truſt.</p>
               <p>The King being informed, who ſeveral of the Conſpirators were, cauſed them to be Seized and Committed to Priſon in <hi>London;</hi> the Chief were <hi>John Ratclif,</hi> Lord <hi>Fitz-Walter,</hi> Sir <hi>Simon Montfort,</hi> and Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Thwaites,</hi> Knights; <hi>William Dawbeney, Robert Ratclif, Richard Lacy,</hi> with divers others: Some Prieſts: <hi>William Richeford</hi> and <hi>Thomas Ponys,</hi> Dominican Fryers; <hi>William Sutton, Robert Laybourn,</hi> and <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Worſley</hi> Dean of St. <hi>Pauls.</hi> The reſt finding their practiſes were diſcovered, fled to ſeveral places of Refuge: They were all Condemned as Traytors, but only theſe

John Ratclif,</hi> Lord <hi>Fitzwalter,</hi> was carried to <hi>Calais,</hi> where for endeavouring to make his Eſcape, he loſt his Head likewiſe: The reſt the King Pardoned.</p>
               <p>Not long after Sir <hi>Robert Clifford</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, and the King choſe to ſpeak with him in the <hi>Tower,</hi> that in caſe he accuſed any Great Men about his Perſon, he might ſecure them there. Much diſcourſe there was touching <hi>Cliffords</hi> Conduct; ſome thought him all along to have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd by the King, to diſcover the reſt. This was occaſioned by the ready obtaining his Pardon, and his Return made him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually decry'd by both Parties; his Friends believing him a Cheat, but the ſmall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration the King had of him generally, convinced People, he acted as he thought, through his Inclination to the Houſe of <hi>York,</hi> being deceived into the perſuaſion it was the true Prince. He threw himſelf at the Kings Feet, giving an account what paſſed in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and naming amongſt his Accomplices Sir <hi>William Stanley:</hi> It much aſtoniſhed the King, he being his Lord Chamberlain, to whom he truſted his moſt Important Affairs, and who had gain'd him the Crown, which was wore

               <p>Theſe Conſiderations made him in ſome ſuſpence, but the conſequence of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample prevail'd, and he was Beheaded as the reſt were. The King was under a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to uſe that Rigour, for hindring the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent diſcourſes of the common People, who talkt Maliciouſly, and Curſed him at their little Meetings; ſaying aloud, <hi>They expected every day the Duke of</hi> York, <hi>and to ſee him on the Throne.</hi> But theſe Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:98570:54"/>and the Method he uſed in his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, extinguiſhed great part of thoſe Heats, and reſtored many People to their Duty. <hi>Giles</hi> Lord <hi>Dawbeney,</hi> whoſe Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Fidelity, the King was well aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of, poſſeſt the Place of Lord Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, Vacant by the Death of Sir <hi>William Stanley.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Iriſh</hi> more than ever perſiſting in their raſh unadviſedneſs, it was reſolved to endeavour to cruſh thoſe Seeds of Sedition <hi>Perkin</hi> had ſown amongſt them, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Years: For which Intent, the King ſent <hi>Henry Denny</hi> Abbot of <hi>Langton,</hi> a Wiſe and Contriving Man, whom he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to make Chancellor of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, making Sir <hi>Edward Poynings,</hi> his <hi>Colleague,</hi> who was to command the Army. Theſe two Perſons repreſenting the two Arms of Juſtice, one holding the Scales, the other the Sword; ſhewing above the Cheats of an Impoſtor, the Majeſty of a Lawful King, <hi>Non ſolum Armis decoratam, ſed &amp; Legibus armatam.</hi> They had order to go where he had been, and take an exact account, who they were, that reſolved to aſſiſt him, and to Arm all they could, to purſue the Accomplices.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ireland</hi> was divided into two ſorts of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, the one Civilized through the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:98570:55"/>converſe with other Nations, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> The others Wild and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage, as any upon Earth, living by Theft, enclin'd to Rebellion and Novely, deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another, according to the Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and Avarice of thoſe they follow. <hi>Perkin</hi> knowing the Genius and Turbulent Spirits of the latter, addreſſed himſelf to them: Theſe Sir <hi>Edward Poynings</hi> attackt chiefly, knowing them moſt Guilty; but they would never ſtand the ſhock, always flying to their Boggs and Mountains. The other <hi>Iriſh</hi> did not obey his Orders, nor ſend him Succours as they promiſed, which made him give over the Purſuit, believing the old Governour <hi>Gerald</hi> Earl of <hi>Kildare</hi> favoured them underhand; wherefore he cunningly ſeized his Perſon, and brought him to the King; before whom, this Earl ſo pleaded his Cauſe, that he was ſent back, and reſtored to his Government, being thought the moſt prudent way in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture, becauſe of his great Intereſt and Authority with the <hi>Iriſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>While theſe things were tranſacting in <hi>England, Warbeck</hi> was extreamly grieved, his Conſpiracy was diſcovered, and many of his chiefeſt Friends Executed: Yet he, notwithſtanding, reſolved to croſs the Sea, accompanied by a great number of Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:98570:55"/>ſuch Fugitives as would follow him. 'Tis true he had ſome Lords, and good Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in his Train, to ſtrengthen his hopes of the Crown. His Fleet came upon the Coaſt of <hi>Kent,</hi> where the weather being calm, he Landed ſome of his Men, for the better ſecuring or perſuading the Country People to his Party: But the Impoſtor was already known every where, and they had ſuffered much Miſery and Deſolation in the late Wars. They knew the Soldiers of this falſe <hi>Richard</hi> were all Strangers, who would make no diſtinction of Friends or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, where they were ſtrong enough to Plunder and Pillage, nor have reſpect to Churches, or Places Sacred; believing God had left them, ſince ſeveral of their Party had been put to ſhameful, deaths, as a puniſhment of their Guilt. Wherefore theſe Inhabitants endeavoured to deſtroy this Counterfeit, by perſuading him to Land all his Men; promiſing to give notice to their Neighbours, and make a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable body, while he prepared for his March. <hi>Perkin</hi> diſtruſted their Intentions, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the common People uſe no Ceremony in their Emotions, but run on without Reaſon or Deliberation: Therefore he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved not to Land himſelf, but to venture part of his Men, who were no ſooner out
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:98570:56"/>of ſight, when the Country People Charged them; driving them back to the Sea, ſo that only the moſt Nimble and moſt Cowardly eſcaped, the Stouteſt and Robuſt were killed or wounded: The latter were not treated as Priſoners of War, but like Pirats and Thieves, 150 being Hanged along the Shore. The King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was on his March from <hi>London,</hi> againſt theſe Vagabonds; till meeting the news of their Defeat, he returned; ſending only Sir <hi>Richard Guilford</hi> to thank the <hi>Kentiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> for their Loyalty, and aſſure them of his Grace and Favour; incouraging them to perſiſt in the ſame Fidelity and Zeal for his Intereſt.</p>
               <p>Though this ill ſucceſs troubled <hi>Warbeck,</hi> and his Friends, who returned to <hi>Flanders,</hi> they gave not over for it, taking new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions of Landing in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men there, for the Invading the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern parts of <hi>England:</hi> And if that failed, to go for <hi>Scotland;</hi> which Nation had never Peace long with the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> His Aunt giving him Money for the equipping a Fleet, and making ſome Levies. He Sayled with good Weather, to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Coaſts, where he ſoon found the inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity between thoſe unarmed, unexperienced People, and the, <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forces; yet not
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:98570:56"/>daring to expoſe his Men to the Slaughter, he rather choſe the other Project of paſſing into <hi>Scotland,</hi> where <hi>James</hi> the Fourth was not diſpleaſed at the Arrival of a Perſon ſo much diſcours'd of through all <hi>Europe,</hi> out of the Averſion his People had for the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> giving him Acceſs to his Royal Perſon, where <hi>Polydore Virgil</hi> ſays, he made this Speech.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I know (Great Prince) you cannot be Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant what Calamities have late befallen the Family of</hi> Edward <hi>the Fourth, King of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>whoſe Son (I aſſure your Majeſty) I am; having by a Miracle eſcaped Death. My Father, e're he dyed, made</hi> Richard <hi>Duke of</hi> Gloceſter <hi>my Uncle, Guardian to</hi> Edward <hi>my Elder Brother, and my ſelf; hoping the great kindneſs he always favoured him with, would oblige him to more tenderneſs of us: But alas! how was he deceived, for our Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian became our Murderer: Tranſported by his Ambition of Reigning, he gave his poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Commands for our Deſtruction. The Perſon he inſtructed with his Orders, frighted with the horror of the Crime, obey'd but half his Inſtructions: For after he had taken away my Brother's, ſparing my life, he ſuffered a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servant to convey me out of the Kingdom, who left me not till I was paſt all danger. By theſe Methods my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle</hi> Richard <hi>ſeized the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:98570:57"/>Crown, as if it had been the Reward of his Crimes, whilſt I (after this Deliverance) wandring about the World, almoſt forgot who I was. At laſt coming to my Aunt</hi> Margaret, <hi>Widow of that moſt excellent Prince,</hi> Charles, <hi>late Duke of</hi> Burgundy; <hi>ſhe received me with unſpeakable joy, as riſen from the dead: But that Princeſs having only her Joynture in</hi> Flanders, <hi>and not able to aſſiſt me with Force enough, for the recovery of my Kingdom, I have been conſtrained to have Recourſe to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princes: And by her advice, I am come to Your Majeſty, though ſlenderly accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Yet knowing your Princely Generoſity, which has filled the World with your Glory; particularly for your Inclination to protect the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhappy, Diſpoſſeſſed of their Rights; who becoming Objects of the Cruelty of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men, are ſo much the greater of Your Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Clemency. This encourages me, to implore Your Majeſty's Aſſiſtance, for this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhappy Prince here before You, for the Recovery of his antient Kingdom: And I aſſure you, I and my Succeſſors will ſo acknowledge Your Majeſty's Grace and Favour, that this Crown will not repent the Kindneſs; though, to ſay truly, it is above all we can do, to expreſs our Gratitude as we ought.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>King <hi>James</hi> anſwer'd his Speech very ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:98570:57"/>exhorting him to take Courage; and aſſure himſelf, he ſhould not repent his coming thither. He Aſſembled his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, who were much divided in their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions; ſome taking him for an <hi>Impoſtor;</hi> others (whoſe Advice prevailed) affirming, that if he were the true <hi>Duke of York,</hi> both He and all his Poſterity muſt acknowledge this Favour, and for it, be obliged to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> Or although he ſhould prove a Counterfeit, this Pretence of War would make the <hi>Engliſh</hi> treat with more inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to grant what they deſired, for the diſ-engaging the <hi>Scots</hi> from his Intereſt. This laſt Advice was followed by the <hi>King,</hi> who ſhewed <hi>Perkin</hi> extraordinary Reſpects, ſtiling him <hi>Highneſs,</hi> and <hi>Duke of York:</hi> And to advance his Credit, he married him to his Kinſwoman <hi>Katharine,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Alexander</hi> Earl of <hi>Huntley;</hi> a Lady of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Beauty and Vertue, whoſe O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the <hi>King,</hi> rather than the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of having her Head Crowned one day with a Royal Diadem, o're-came the Repugnance ſhe had in her Heart, to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a Man ſo unknown, whom many called an <hi>Impoſtor.</hi> The Motives which perſwaded the <hi>King</hi> to this Match, were for a ſpecious Pretext of War, and breaking the Truce with the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> He being by this obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:98570:58"/>to protect his new Kinſman and Ally, without being accounted raſh in his Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, if the Deceit ſhould be diſcovered; for this Marriage muſt needs perſwade the World, he thought him the true <hi>Duke of York.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>King <hi>James</hi> raiſed Men, and formed an Army; which, you will ſuppoſe, gave the <hi>Impoſtor</hi> great Satisfaction. And now his Senſes were charmed with the Sound of War-like Muſick, as well as with the ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Concerts of his Wedding. <hi>Courriers</hi> were ſent into <hi>England,</hi> to obſerve what Preparations were making for Reſiſtance. But all being quiet; the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army, with their <hi>King</hi> at the Head, entred <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland;</hi> where they pillaged, burnt, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed, and killed, ſparing neither Age nor Sex; behaving themſelves, without Humanity: Till the Soldiers, laden with Plunder, refuſed to March further, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding no <hi>Engliſh</hi> joyned them. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit <hi>Richard,</hi> one day hearing the Crys of the poor plunder'd <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſeemed much afflicted; ſaying, <hi>Oh! how wretched am I, and my Heart as hard as Steel, not to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at the Miſery of my People!</hi> Intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>King,</hi> to prevent the Cruelty of the Soldiers, and not ſuffer them to deſtroy his unhappy Country; feigning great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:98570:58"/>and Tenderneſs: Who anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him very coldly; <hi>He might concern him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with his own Affairs, and not with other Mens;</hi> calling England <hi>his Country and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; where none came to his Aſſiſtance, though a War was undertaken for his Cauſe.</hi> So chiding this Mock-King's Diſſimulation, and changing from that time, his Reſpect to him; Neglecting, and contemning him, when he found neither his Actions, nor the Event of things, correſpond with his former Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> prepared to meet, and repell the Scotch-Men, at the News of this their Cruelty and Infidelity; when the Lords on the Marches, informed him of their Retreat; They having done the beſt they could, by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenching &amp; Fortifying themſelves, with an Intent, as they did, by their frequent <hi>Allarms</hi> and Skirmiſhes, to waſt and tire out the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy. Juſt before this Advice, he Summons a <hi>Parliament</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> where ſeveral good Laws were made, for the Publick Safety: But Money being the Sinews of War, they concluded on the Methods of raiſing it. <hi>Giles Lord Dawbeney,</hi> who was General of the Army, had Orders to begin his March for the Frontiers of <hi>Scotland:</hi> But he had ſcarce ſet forward, when the <hi>Corniſh</hi> Men took up Arms, alledging for their Pretence
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:98570:59"/>great Taxes laid on them (as they ſaid) for an Inconſiderable <hi>Scotch-War,</hi> which was ended already; when indeed it was but juſt begun: And then their Barren Land, and hard Labour of Mineing, making them Incapable to pay them. <hi>Thomas Flammock,</hi> a Country-Lawyer, and <hi>Michael Joſeph</hi> a Farrier, two bold Fellows, being at the Head of the Rebels, they Marched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>London,</hi> and demanded the Heads of <hi>John Morton,</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and Sir <hi>Reynald Bray,</hi> both Privy-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors; And at <hi>Wells,</hi> they were Joyned by <hi>James Twichet,</hi> Lord <hi>Awdley,</hi> and ſome other Gentlemen. King <hi>Henry</hi> conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Troubles ſhould be firſt appeaſed, recalled the Lord <hi>Dawbency,</hi> with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, ſending <hi>Thomas Howard,</hi> Earl of <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> in his ſtead, a moſt experienced Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier; To whom he had given his Life and Liberty, after the Famous Battle of <hi>Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth-Field,</hi> which he had won of <hi>Richard</hi> the Uſurper; afterwards honouring him with the Office of <hi>Lord High Treaſurer of England,</hi> upon the Death of <hi>John Lord Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi> This Earls Commands were, to raiſe what Men he could, about the County of <hi>Durham,</hi> and oppoſe the Incurſions of the <hi>Scots,</hi> till <hi>Giles</hi> Lord <hi>Dawbeney</hi> ſhould have Diſſipated, and Chaſtized the Rebels of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:98570:59"/>
                  <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and Joyn'd him with his Army. <hi>Polydore Virgil</hi> Names the Lords, and the Gentlemen, who met the Royal Army, commanded by <hi>Dawbeney,</hi> increaſing it with their Tennants.</p>
               <p>About this time, <hi>Charles the</hi> 8<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> ſent an Ambaſſador to give the <hi>King</hi> an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Conquering the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> and to renew his Allyance with <hi>England: Henry</hi> ſent ſome Lords to meet them, ſo ſoon as he knew they were arrived at <hi>Calais,</hi> and alſo to amuſe them at <hi>Dover,</hi> that they might not underſtand the Revolt in the Weſt, till it was ſuppreſt: in which he was exactly obey'd.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the Rebels decamped from <hi>Wells,</hi> Marched to <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> hoping thoſe People would Joyn with them; but they were much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; for they found them Armed, and ready to oppoſe them; being Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>George</hi> Earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> Lord <hi>Brook,</hi> with Fifteen or Sixteen other Lords. The Reſolution, and Fidelity, of theſe Men, ſo aſtoniſht the Rebels Army, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny abandoned them, Running from their Camp in the Night: But they were too far advanced for a Retreat; ſo continued their March to <hi>Black-Heath,</hi> near <hi>London;</hi> where they drew up themſelves, in Order to a
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:98570:60"/>Battle, upon the Hill. Thither, the <hi>King</hi> ſent, <hi>Henry Bourcheir Earl</hi> of <hi>Eſſex, Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi> dela <hi>Pool</hi> Earl of <hi>Suffolk.</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Thomas,</hi> and Sir <hi>Humphrey Stanly,</hi> all Great Souldiers, with detached Parties, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs them, and hinder their Flight; whilſt he March't ſtreight to charge them, with <hi>Dawbeney,</hi> followed by the beſt Men of his Army: Commanding Sir <hi>Richard Thomas,</hi> to attack them, at the ſame time, from his Poſt; which was ſo vigourouſly executed, that notwithſtanding all their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, the Rebels were broken and loſt Two Thouſand Men, beſides vaſt Numbers of Priſoners; the <hi>King</hi> miſſing but Three Hundred: He pardon'd thoſe wretched People, only making their Chiefs, Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; among whom was the Lord <hi>Audley,</hi> who was drawn from <hi>Newgate</hi> to <hi>Tower-Hill,</hi> and there beheaded; <hi>Thomas Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mock,</hi> and <hi>Michael Joſeph,</hi> were Hanged and Quarter'd, and their Heads and Limbs ſet up in <hi>London,</hi> and ſeveral places of <hi>Cornwall;</hi> for the Terror and Example of others. They admired the Conſtancy of <hi>Michael</hi> the Smith, who contented himſelf, that he ſhould always be talked of: <hi>A Deo</hi> (ſays <hi>Polydore</hi>) <hi>Medios ac inſimos viros, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinde ut Summos, Gloriae cupiditas incendit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Scotch King,</hi> taking Advantage by
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:98570:60"/>theſe Diſorders, entred the County of <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> giving his Men all manner of Licence: With ſome of his Troops he Beſieged <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> a Caſtle of Great Importance, on thoſe Frontiers; into which <hi>Richard Fox,</hi> the Vigilant Biſhop of <hi>Durham,</hi> had put a ſtrong Garriſon, and well fortified the Place, having foreſeen the Siege: He then advertiſed <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Surry,</hi> who had already raiſed a conſiderable Army in <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire;</hi> and hearing the diſtreſs that <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was in, he Marched with all ſpeed, having a Great number of Gentlemen, and Knights with him, and a Body of near Twenty Thouſand Men, beſides a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Fleet at Sea. King <hi>James</hi> informed of his Advancing, being within Two Days March, Haſtily raiſed his Siege, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired into <hi>Scotland,</hi> where he was follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Earl; who being in the Enemies Country, plundred all he could and took ſeveral Towns: But having no oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to furniſh himſelf with Proviſions, he returned into the County of <hi>Durham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During the War, about this time, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Hyalas,</hi> a wiſe and prudent Man, came Ambaſſador, and Mediator from <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and <hi>Iſabella</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> a moſt Incomparable Princeſs. King <hi>Henry</hi> appointed for his Ambaſſador, <hi>Richard</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Durham,</hi>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:98570:61"/>who was near the Place of Treaty; where they met the King of <hi>Scotlands</hi> Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, and treated of the Conditions of Peace. The greateſt difficulty aroſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Perkin Warbeck; Henry</hi> Poſitively perſiſting, to have him delivered up, as being the Diſturber of his Kingdoms Peace, and the Occaſion of ſo many Rebellions. The King of <hi>Scotland</hi> could not in Honour, yeild to deliver up a Man to Death, whom he had raiſed, and made his Kinſman. So, at laſt, it was agreed, that he ſhould quit his Intereſt, and command him out of his Dominions. Theſe Articles were agreed on, and a Peace was made between them in the Year, 1498. <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> ſent home this <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador, Loaden with Preſents, and with great Thanks to his King and Queen.</p>
               <p>Then was the Marriage projected of Prince <hi>Arthur,</hi> the Kings Eldeſt Son, and <hi>Katharine</hi> the <hi>Infanta,</hi> afterwards Marryed to <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. his Second Son; whoſe Famous Divorce, cauſed ſo many Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Kingdom. About the ſame time, King <hi>Henry</hi> Received two other Embaſſies; One, from the King of <hi>France;</hi> the Other, from Prince <hi>Philip,</hi> Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> Son to the Emperour <hi>Maximilan,</hi> who renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Alliance with Him. The King of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:98570:61"/>
                  <hi>Scotland</hi> exactly obſerved the Articles of Peace, touching <hi>Perkin Warbeck;</hi> being wholly diſabuſed concerning him. He ſent for him, and told him in ſhort, what he had <hi>done in his Favour; but he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf obliged to conclude a Peace with</hi> England; <hi>and now was no longer in Circumſtances to give him aſſiſtance, or allow him his Court for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat: Therefore, adviſed him to retire, and hope a better Fortune.</hi> Though this was a Fatal Blow to <hi>Warbeck,</hi> it came not unfore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen by him, who wanted not Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but extreamly thanked the <hi>King;</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring him, he could never acknowledge his Favours as he ought, and deſired ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcing in his Orders.</p>
               <p>After this, with his Wife he went for <hi>Ireland,</hi> with Intention either to go for <hi>Flanders,</hi> to his Aunt; or head the <hi>Corniſh Malecontents:</hi> But reſolving on the latter, he found the Minds of thoſe People, irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by their Loſſes, and eaſily engaged them to Mutiny. He then gave out his Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Formed his Army, with Deſign to ſurprize ſome conſiderable Towns; which might ſerve for a Refuge, in caſe of ill Succeſs. With this intent, he Beſieged <hi>Exeter,</hi> uſing all Endeavours, to carry it by Aſſault, and trying to ſeize the Gates; for Petards nor Rams were not then in Uſe;
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:98570:62"/>he brought Great Stones, and Axes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of thoſe Engins; which not taking effect, he employ'd Fire; and heaping Wood againſt the Gates, indeavoured to burn them: The Beſieged uſed the ſame Expedient, Fireing great quantity of Wood, within their Gates; by Flames preventing their Danger by Fire. He then raiſed his Scaling Ladders, and commanded the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack to be made, which was better repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, many of his Men being left dead un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Walls, the very Women throwing Stones, and Scalding Water on the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegers.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> being Informed, what Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the Beſieged were in, advanced with great Marches to their Aſſiſtance; ſending Detached Partys, to declare His Coming. In the mean time, ſeveral Men of Quality got into the City, with ſupplyes. Amongſt whom, was <hi>Edward Courtney,</hi> Earl of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonſhire,</hi> and ſeveral of his Family; <hi>Peter Edgcomb</hi> and <hi>William</hi> St. <hi>Maure</hi> and other Men of Noto: This extreamly perplexed <hi>Perkin;</hi> he could not cover his Men in any ſtrong Place; who for the moſt part of them, were ill provided of Armes, as well Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive as Defenſive; and conſidering he was not able to reſiſt ſo Powerful Enemies, as were advancing towards him; he raiſed
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:98570:62"/>the Siege, and Marched to <hi>Taunton;</hi> where he Muſter'd his Men, and drew them up in Battalia; of which the <hi>King</hi> hearing, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected his March that way; many Lords Joyning Him, and giving Demonſtrations of their Zeal, to expreſs and Signalize their Loyalty on that Occaſion. The <hi>King</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded my Lord <hi>Brook,</hi> my Lord <hi>Dawbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard Thomas,</hi> with a Party of choſen detached Men, to begin the Charge; but both his Orders, and their Reſolutions were needleſs: For <hi>Warbeck,</hi> through his own Natural Cowardize, or believing himſelf betray'd, ran away, and left his Army; flying into the Monaſtery of <hi>Beaulieu.</hi> His Officers ſeeing themſelves abandonned, loſt their Reſolution, and try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſave themſelves by Flight. The wretched Multitude, being left without a Head, knew not what to do; whether to reſolve to dye Fighting, or to Implore the <hi>Kings</hi> Mercy: But chooſing the latter, they threw down their Armes, and on their Knees, begged Pardon; which the <hi>King</hi> granted them: For certainly, if their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers had not left them, it would have coſt him very dear, they being reſolved to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come or dye. Partyes of Light-Horſe were ſent every way, for the Apprehenſion of <hi>Warbeck,</hi> and the Chief of his Gang: But
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:98570:63"/>though they miſſed him, they took moſt of the others his Accomplices: Some of the Searchers found <hi>Katharine Huntley,</hi> Wife of <hi>Perkin,</hi> with her Women; Her they brought to the <hi>King;</hi> who was much fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized to ſee ſo Beautiful a Lady; extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pittying her Misfortune: And conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a Noble Prize, was not fit to be the Souldiers Prey, but worthy an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; He ſent her to <hi>London,</hi> where he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Queen this unfortunate Lady, ſo unhappily Sacrificed to the Humour, or Intereſts of the <hi>King</hi> her Uncle: &amp; Match't to a Villain, and <hi>Impoſtor,</hi> inſtead of a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate Prince, whom ſhe juſtly Merited, and not the extream Grief, of ſeeing this Counterfeit, her Husband, ſuffer the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Reproaches, and Calumny, of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt Profligates.</p>
               <p>The <hi>King</hi> Encompaſt the Monaſtery of <hi>Beaulieu,</hi> with his Army, for the better ſecuring <hi>Perkin:</hi> Not being willing to Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate the Sanctuary; he himſelf having been protected the ſame manner in <hi>Bretagn,</hi> when <hi>Richard</hi> the Uſurper, demanded him. Beſides, ſuch was the Cuſtome of thoſe days. Wherefore, he ſent him word by the Religious Men of the Monaſtery, that he would ſpare his Life; aſſuring him of his Clemency: yet nevertheleſs, at <hi>Exeter,</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:98570:63"/>he beheaded ſeveral of the Principal Rebels, puniſhing many of the reſt, which were taken in their Flight; thanking that City for their Zeal and Fidelity. With <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck</hi> in his Power, he return'd for <hi>London,</hi> where the People, in Multitudes, Flock't to ſee <hi>Perkin,</hi> with aſtoniſhment; admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that a Forreigner, of ſo mean Birth, ſhould undertake by his Impoſtures, the Overthrow of ſo great a Kingdome; and perſwade ſo many Princes, Lords, and People, (to the Deſtruction of many) of the Truth of thoſe Falſehoods, he till then ſpread abroad, both of his Perſon and Birth.</p>
               <p>There is no doubt, but that the <hi>King</hi> kept him cloſe Priſoner, and juſtly puniſh't thoſe remarkable Rebels of <hi>Cornwall, Devon,</hi> and <hi>Sommerſetſhire;</hi> for which Service, he ſent <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Darcy,</hi> Sir <hi>Anyas Paw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,</hi> and <hi>Robert Sherburn</hi> Dean of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> with his Commiſſion into the <hi>Weſt,</hi> where they ſoundly Fined, &amp; Amerced every one, that had Aſſiſted or Favoured the Rebels, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or after their Defeat at <hi>Black-heath:</hi> But yet with conſideration of ſuch Perſons, who either through Fear, or by Force were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd to do it.</p>
               <p>There happened about this time, a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scotch,</hi> that
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:98570:64"/>had like to have renewed the War. Some <hi>Scotch</hi> were obſerved to walk under the Walls of <hi>Norham,</hi> which a little before they had Beſieged; and the next day do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it again, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Garriſon, fearing they had ſome Deſign, ſent out to know their Reaſons, and whether they came not as Spies. From Words, they ſoon came to Blows; which put the <hi>Scotch,</hi> who were fewer in Number, to Flight, leaving ſeveral Dead on the Place. At this, the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> was incenſed, demanding the Violaters of the Peace, in his Letters, where he highly complain'd of them. The King of <hi>England</hi> tryed to appeaſe Him, promiſing exemplary Puniſhment on the Aggreſſors. <hi>Richard Fox,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> (being extreamly diſpleaſed, that the Garriſon he had placed there, ſhould give Occaſion of Variance, between thoſe two Monarchs, who with ſo great Difficulty, were brought to an Accord,) ſent his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to King <hi>James;</hi> aſſuring him, he might expect all poſſible Satisfaction. This Prince, who very much eſteemed him, honoured him with an Anſwer, and an Invitation to come, and diſcourſe of Matters. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop immediately informed the King, his Maſter; who permitted him to go. It was in this Viſit, that King <hi>James</hi> told him,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:98570:64"/>
                  <hi>If He did not fear a Denyal, he would ask the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs</hi> Margaret, <hi>his Maſter's Eldeſt Daughter, in Marriage.</hi> The Biſhop encouraged his Hopes, undertaking to ſound the Affair, without ingaging His Honour in it. King <hi>Henry</hi> rejoyced at the Overture, and accepted it with all His Heart. It was from this Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the Princeſs <hi>Margaret,</hi> to <hi>James</hi> the Fourth King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that <hi>James</hi> the Sixth of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and ſince King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as next Heir, Inherited the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> after the Death of Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> in the Year 1603.</p>
               <p>Now, we will declare the Cataſtrophe, and Death of the Impoſtor <hi>Perkin;</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with that of the Unfortunate Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Warbeck</hi>'s Turbulent Spirit, ill brooking ſo ſtrait an Impriſonment, endeavoured to make his Eſcape; and finding his Guards to abate ſomething of their firſt ſtrictneſs, got out of Priſon, directing his Flight to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Sea-ſide, for Shipping off pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately; which in <hi>England,</hi> after Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to the contrary, is very difficult. He was quickly miſs'd, and every way purſued: He carefully watching, hid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Ditches, and behind the Hedges; till the Horſemen that ſought him, were
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:98570:65"/>paſt: When deſpairing to get out of the Iſland, and finding himſelf reduced to the utmoſt Diſtreſs, he waited the Obſcurity of the Night, and got to a Monaſtery; where asking for the <hi>Prior,</hi> and throwing his Arms about his Neck, he declared his Misfortune. The Father touched with his Miſery, promiſed to ſpeak to the <hi>King;</hi> which accordingly he did; whoſe Piety granted his Life, without other preſent Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; provided he no more attempted to eſcape.</p>
               <p>The Counterfeit was then led in Chains to <hi>London;</hi> where before <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> he was, in a pair of Stocks, expoſed a whole Day, to the Scorn and Mockery of the People. The next day, enduring the ſame in the City; where he declared his Parentage, the Place of his Birth, and all the Paſſages of his Life; and by what Means he was induced to make this Attempt: and from thence he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed into the <hi>Tower.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for Young <hi>Edward,</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> he had been a Priſoner from his Cradle; bred up out of the Sight of Men or Beaſts: So that he could not diſtinguiſh a <hi>Gooſe</hi> from a <hi>Hen,</hi> and incapable of doing any thing worthy of <hi>death:</hi> He was nevertheleſs brought to it by the Crimes of Others.</p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:98570:65"/>
               <p>That Age being Fruitful in <hi>Impoſtors,</hi> an <hi>Auguſtine Monk,</hi> called <hi>Patrick,</hi> ſuborned a Youth, whoſe Name we find not, with Promiſes of Raiſing him to the Crown, and to better Fortune than <hi>Perkin Warbeck</hi>'s, provided he would paſs for the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> and but leave him alone to Act the reſt. Ambition had ſuch Charms with the Young Man, that he undertook it, and hazarded all was deſired of him. So they came to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> where they told their forged Adventure: The <hi>Fryar</hi> declaring how dextrouſly he had got the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> out of Priſon; and ſome credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous People believing the Story: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had time to cheat the World, the King ſent, and apprehended the Two Sparks; Hanged the Youth, and Immured the <hi>Monk;</hi> according to the Cuſtom of thoſe Times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Perkin</hi> continued ſtill the ſame, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and endeavouring to break looſe once more; and having corrupted ſome of his Guards, deſign'd to Murther the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the <hi>Tower,</hi> and carrying the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> with him, to get out by Force; which being diſcovered, he was by the Judges condemned for this laſt Action on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and a few days after, hanged accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:98570:66"/>
               <p>As for the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> he loſt his Head, for liſtening to him, and intending to Eſcape with him. This Unhappy Prince bearing the Iniquity of his Father, <hi>George,</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> who was the Barbarous Murtherer of Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> only Son, and deſign'd Succeſſor of <hi>Henry the Sixth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You may imagine the Aſtoniſhment and Affliction the Dutcheſs <hi>Margaret</hi> was in, for the Unfortunate End of her Pretended Nephew, whom ſhe had taken ſuch Pains to ſet on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Throne, by ſo many Impoſtures.</p>

               <p>This made him Croſs the Sea, to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the Aſſiſtance of King <hi>Don Sebaſtian,</hi> who, moved with hopes of converting the <hi>Moores,</hi> through more Zeal than Prudence, and heightned by his Deſire of Glory, heard the <hi>Affrican</hi> Kings Proteſtations; from whom he promiſed himſelf great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, for the Chriſtian Religion, for the Reputation of his Name, and the Utility and Profit of his Subjects.

Some of the Wounded Men, who had yet a Glimmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of underſtanding left them, told the Place where <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> Fought; and carefully obſerving thoſe Bodys, ſhe eſpy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one extreamly reſembling her Lover; and with great Crys, ſhe embraced, and moved him, reſolving to Dye there; when the ſuppoſed Dead Man came to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, a little opening his Eyes, and ſpake a few words imperfectly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Xerine,</hi> being Tranſported with Joy, by the help of her Slave, carryed him to the Bank of the River <hi>Mucazen,</hi> which runs through thoſe Plaines; where ſhe waſh't, and bound up his Wounds, ſending <hi>Laura</hi> to a little houſe hard by, for ſome body to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move him from thence.

               <p>The Allyance, which <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> had with <hi>Muley Mahomet,</hi> made his Death neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the Peace of the new King <hi>Hamet;</hi> ſo
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:98570:71"/>the <hi>Xerine</hi> fear'd equally the Life, &amp; Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of her Lover, if he fell into his hands: ſhe tended, and dreſt him, till his Recovery; One Day ſaying to him; <hi>Heaven will not deprive</hi> Portugal <hi>of it's King; But has made your</hi> Xerine <hi>happy, in ſaving her Dear</hi> Don Sebaſtian<hi>'s Life.</hi> The Wounded Man ſoon found the Princeſſes Error, without intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to undeceive her; but uſing his Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to confirm her miſtake, from which he foreſaw ſuch happy Conſequences: Therefore, gave her Infinite Thanks, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring ſhe would <hi>inform</hi> him, how ſhe diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh't him among the Dead; of which ſhe told him the Particulars.

               <p>
                  <hi>Xerine,</hi> underſtood by thoſe, whom ſhe had ſent to enquire for News, that King <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> was drowned, in his endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſave himſelf; but none could find his Body. This Truth ſhe thought an Error; as ſhe believed her own Error true; promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her ſelf no leſs, than to be Queen of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal;</hi> and thinking her Care, kind Words, and obliging Promiſes, well beſtowed on that Subject.</p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:98570:71"/>
               <p>The <hi>Portugueze</hi> having ſpirit enough, to ſupport this Caprice of Fortune, ſoon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Princeſſes Diſcourſe, that <hi>Muley Boabdelin,</hi> a Prince of the Blood Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of <hi>Morocco,</hi> had always been a Friend to <hi>Don Sebaſtian:</hi> He ſent him word, that the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> was not dead; and if he would come to the Iſland of <hi>Mucazen,</hi> he ſhould hear of him. <hi>Maley Boabdelin</hi> came in great haſte, with the Envoy <hi>Xerine</hi> ſent, leaving the fartheſt Part of the Province <hi>Hoſcore,</hi> whither he was ſled, to avoid the Tyranny of <hi>Muley Moluc,</hi> generally called <hi>Abdelmeleck:</hi> When he Arrived, he was deceived by the reſemblance, as the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs had been. There was great Embracing, careſſing, and mutual kindneſs betwixt them: By him, the Falſe <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, That his Uncle, the <hi>Cardinal Don Henry,</hi> Reigned in his ſtead, by the conſent of the People. This News much diſturbed him; believing it very difficult to diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs him. <hi>Muley Boabdelin</hi> was of his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; they both concluded it proper to ſound the Inclinations of the <hi>Portuguezes,</hi> and try to Oblige the Principal Miniſters of State, to Aſſert and Maintain their Monarch's Right, before he ſhould expoſe himſelf to the Policies of the New King, This <hi>Moor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Prince,</hi> at the ſame time, offering <hi>Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:98570:72"/>and her Lover, a retreat in <hi>Hoſcore,</hi> where he was ſo well fortified, that he had no occaſion to fear any thing.</p>
               <p>They all agreed not to Publiſh any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi>'s being alive, till he were in a Condition of Poſſeſſing his Crown: But to Authorize what the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs had done in his. Favour, <hi>Muley</hi> Advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to marry <hi>Xerine,</hi> which ſhe alſo wiſh't; believing by that tye, her hopes ſecured. This Effect of his likeneſs to <hi>Don Sebastian,</hi> made him deſirous to taſte the Fruit of it; he was charmed with the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Paſſion of the Princeſs; and had Reaſon to be ſo: Therefore fulfilled her deſire, with as much Joy, as Speed: By this becoming Victorious, and the moſt happy of Mankind. But when he had thus made what Advantages he could, the private Negotiation of <hi>Portugal</hi> ſeemed too ſlow; ſo he reſolved to go, and manage his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs there in Perſon: Upon which, <hi>Xeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne</hi> and he had many Diſcourſes. <hi>Europe,</hi> (ſaid ſhe, one day to him) Aſia, <hi>or</hi> Affrick, <hi>are all equal to me, provided I have you with me: Do not then refuſe me the Pleaſure of following you: 'Tis a Debt to my Love: Let me not be ſo unhappy, to find any other thing more Powerful in your Soul; ſince I have the Glory of Contributing to your Eſtabliſhment,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:98570:72"/>when Pretentions had been Vain, without me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe tender Expreſſions ſeemed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to <hi>Sebaſtian;</hi> they offended him, which troubled <hi>Xerine,</hi> at laſt they differ'd, and that Difference gave him an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which he lookt for: He had Learned from her, the moſt Particular Affairs of the true <hi>Sebaſtian;</hi> and in theſe Tranſports of their Love, he ask her, <hi>What Part of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, had moſt ſenſibly touch't her; that,</hi> (as he ſaid) <hi>he might often repeat, what he had Practiſed with Succeſs?</hi> The Princeſs inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly told him, It was the ſlighting <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> of <hi>Portugal,</hi> whom he refuſed to Marry, for her ſake: <hi>Beſides</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs was very Beautiful, and Loved you much, as you did her, before you knew me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He well might Love her, for ſhe was a Princeſs of Infinite Wit, whoſe Body and Mind were equally Admirable; her Meen was modeſt, and yet Majeſtick; ſhe was of a moſt accompliſh't Beauty; and indeed, the moſt admirable of that Age. I cannot Read her Character, in <hi>Fam.

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:98570:73"/>This was that Great and moſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowed Souldier of his Time, <hi>Alexander Farneſe,</hi> Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> the King's Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew; who did him thoſe Eminent Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as Governour of the <hi>Low Countrys.</hi> This Princeſs ſpake <hi>Latine</hi> Elegantly, underſtood the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, was perfectly Miſtreſs of the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> a Great Judge of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy,</hi> and Familiar in the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> of both <hi>Teſtaments:</hi> And with all this, was of an admirable Innocence of Manners, and a Holy Life. Of all which, the ſaid <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> gives us the Relation.</p>
               <p>The Pretended <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> being furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with theſe Inſtructions, and above all, with thoſe he had cunningly drawn from <hi>Xerine;</hi> took an Opportunity to croſs the Sea, about Fourteen or Fifteen Years after the Battle of <hi>Alcazer,</hi> Landing in <hi>Italy;</hi> where the Princeſs was then a Widdow; The <hi>Hero,</hi> her Husband, dying at <hi>Arras,</hi> in the Six and Fortieth Year of his <hi>Age,</hi> the Second Day of <hi>December,</hi> 1591. People of this <hi>Sebastian's</hi> Character, uſe not to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of any Circumſtance or thing, which concerns their Relations. He came to <hi>Parma,</hi> where he ſent the Dutcheſs word, that a Gentleman of <hi>Portugal</hi> had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to tell her, which he could declare to none but herſelf.</p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:98570:73"/>
               <p>The Dutcheſs had lately received an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count by a <hi>Courrier</hi> from <hi>Lisbone,</hi> of the Death of the Cardinal <hi>Don Henry,</hi> who laſt filled that Throne, which ſhe now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded for her Son <hi>Rainuccio;</hi> ſhe being the Daughter of <hi>Edward,</hi> one of the Sons of King <hi>Don Emanuel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There were alſo other Pretenders to this Crown of <hi>Portugal,</hi> ſuch was <hi>Emanuel Philibert,</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> by his Mother <hi>Beatrix,</hi> a Daughter of King <hi>Don Emanuel. Katharine,</hi> the Siſter of <hi>Mary,</hi> joyned her Right, with that of the Duke of <hi>Braganza,</hi> a Prince of the Blood Royal of <hi>Portugal,</hi> for her Son <hi>Theodoſio;</hi> and who indeed, by the Law of <hi>Lamega,</hi> which (as they affirm) excludes a Forreigner from the Throne of <hi>Portugal,</hi> had the moſt juſt Pretence to it. <hi>Catharine de Medicis,</hi> Queen of <hi>France,</hi> claimed it, though at greater diſtance. And <hi>Pope Paul the Fourth,</hi> came in with his Title; ſaying, That Crown was a Fief of the <hi>Holy-See,</hi> and therefore at his Diſpoſal. <hi>Philip the Second,</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> was Son of <hi>Iſabel,</hi> Daughter of the ſame King <hi>Don Emanuel,</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> his Wife, was yet near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, being Daughter of <hi>Don John the Third,</hi> Son and Succeſſor to <hi>Don Emanuel.</hi> He was the neareſt in Blood, the nigheſt Neighbour, and the moſt Potent; ſo got Poſſeſſion of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:98570:74"/>the Crown; but not without fighting for it, by Sea and Land. The Naval-Fight, which his Admiral, the <hi>Marquis de Santa Cruz,</hi> obtained of <hi>Peter Strozzi,</hi> a <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> and Marſhal of <hi>France;</hi> who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took by Force, to diſpute the Title of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharine de Medicis,</hi> his Miſtreſs, and kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, was no ſmall Part of <hi>Philip's</hi> good Fortune.</p>
               <p>The Three Eſtates of the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal,</hi> were Aſſembled, to determine this great Controverſy, when <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Dutcheſs of <hi>Parma</hi> had alſo her mind filled with theſe things; but when ſhe perceived Him, ſhe gave a ſhrieck, and ran to the Other end of her Cloſet, much aſtoniſhed. <hi>I bring you</hi> (Madam, ſaid he, approaching her) <hi>Extraordinary news, which will much ſurprize you; the King</hi> Don Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtian <hi>is alive, and not far from hence, not much diſtant from you, for he now ſpeaks to you. What Madam,</hi> (continued he, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out heſitating) <hi>does then</hi> Don Sebaſtian <hi>Fright you? He hoped, that a better Recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would have been the reward of thoſe pains, he has endured to find you.</hi> At the tone of his Voice, the Dutcheſſes trouble was ſo great, ſhe could neither ſpeak, nor move out of her place. <hi>Recollect your ſelf, my dear
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:98570:74"/>Cozen</hi> (ſaid he, with a Paſſionate Air) <hi>I am no Phantaſme, but the ſame</hi> Don Sebaſtian, <hi>you once honoured with your Favour; and now returned, as full of your</hi> Idea, <hi>as I was before I went to</hi> Affrica.</p>
               <p>With theſe Diſcourſes, the Dutcheſs came to her ſelf, and ſuffer'd the Falſe <hi>Don Sebaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> to approach nearer, giving him her hand; and when ſhe was aſſured, that this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Monarch, was a Man, and no Ghoſt; <hi>Ah, my Lord!</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>Whence are you come? where have you been ſo long hid? And by what Miracle are you among the Living? When you are in a Condition to hear me</hi> (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi>) <hi>I will anſwer you all this: But firſt, be not ſo diſturbed; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that I am really the King of</hi> Portugal, <hi>and if neither my Stature, nor my Face aſſure it, let the Paſſion of my Eyes convince you. I have now recovered my Spirits</hi> (ſaid the Princeſs, ſitting down by him) <hi>and confeſs your Sight did affright me, above my Power of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding my Diſturbance: But, Sir, all is now diſſipated: Therefore, pray tell me, to what Wonder we owe your Life, and return to Love. Madam,</hi> (anſwered <hi>Sebaſtian</hi>) <hi>a Paſſion, that had once made me touch your Heart, muſt needs defend me from all Accidents.</hi> Then he told her, how <hi>Xerine</hi> found him among the Dead, his getting into the Iſle of <hi>Mucazen,</hi>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:98570:75"/>and his Living at <hi>Hoſcore;</hi> but carefully concealed, how <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> had Loved <hi>Xerine,</hi> before that Action; and more, his Marriage to her, in <hi>Affrica:</hi> Though that Princeſs uſed her utmoſt Power with <hi>Muley Boabdelin,</hi> her Cozen, and a Prince of the Blood Royal, to oblige him to it, by aſſuring him, the Princeſs <hi>Mary</hi> was Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the Duke of <hi>Parma:</hi> But ſaid, that ſometime after, being informed ſhe was a Widow; He eſcaped (as he pretended) with difficulty, out of Priſon, and came to lay himſelf at her Feet, ſo full of Love, that he had Lived on the very Thoughts of being eſteemed by her. <hi>Why then</hi> (ſaid the Dutcheſs) <hi>did you not Write to me? That I did many times</hi> (reply'd he); <hi>and doubtleſs,</hi> Xerine, <hi>who hoped that from my Misfortunes, which ſhe could not expect from my Re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, gave ſuch Orders, as prevented their coming to your hand. My Reſtraint was very ſevere; I was treated like a Valued Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and had no Opportunity, or Liberty to deliver my ſelf from that Title.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Dutcheſs muſt needs be Tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the Recital of a Conſtancy, ſo well invented. She Ordered an Apartment for him, whom ſhe thought the King (her Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin) together with an Equipage, in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects ſutable; and ſent for the moſt Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:98570:75"/>Perſons, to depute to the Eſtates of <hi>Portugal,</hi> on his behalf; which Deputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on extreamly ſurprized them. They ſent Six of the Chief in their Aſſembly (of whom ſome had been Miniſters to <hi>Don Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtian</hi>) to ſee their Monarch. Their Eyes aſſured them, he was the ſame; they ask't him ſeveral Queſtions, which they thought <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> only could Anſwer: But he was ſo well inſtructed by <hi>Xerine,</hi> as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced the Ambaſſadors, that none but He in the World, could ſo reply: Inſomuch, that they aſſured the Eſtates, he was really their King. Thoſe who were intereſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, accuſed him of being a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit, and Practizer of Deceit, requiring this <hi>Sebastian</hi> to go, and be preſent in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, at the General-Aſſembly of Eſtates, to be Interrogated there in Form concerning his Pretentions: While thoſe who were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate to the Memory and Perſon of <hi>Don Sebaſtian,</hi> thought there was no Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity in that Demand. The Kingdom was hereupon divided; <hi>Thoſe</hi> were called <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſts,</hi> who adhered to the King; and <hi>Thoſe</hi> who declared for the ſeveral Princes, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to the Crown, <hi>Leaguers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During theſe Diſorders, he that cauſed them, lived at <hi>Parma,</hi> expecting an Army ſhould take the Field for his Intereſt: At
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:98570:76"/>the Head of which, he intended to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, what he ſaid was his Right.</p>
               <p>This ſuppoſed Prince, after ſome time, fell into diſgrace with the Dutcheſs of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma;</hi> I know not whither or no, by the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, which <hi>Mademoiſelle des Jardins</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates on this manner: That one Day, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with her by the ſide of that Canal, which is one of the moſt Beautiful Things, belonging to the Palace of <hi>Farneſe,</hi> ſhe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the Ribbon of a Letter-Caſe hanging out of his Pocket, which ſhe ſoftly pulled out; wherein ſhe found Letters, and Verſes, that diſcovered his Love, ſome of them ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Greateſt Liberties of his Marriage with <hi>Xerine,</hi> for their Subject. This ſo poſſeſt the Dutcheſs with Rage, and Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy, that ſhe deſtroy'd all ſhe had before done for him, and declared him an <hi>Impoſtor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Xerine</hi> came ſoon after into <hi>Portugal,</hi> to ſollicite the Eſtabliſhment of her Husband; purely moved by her own Conjugal Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, notwithſtanding his Ingratitude; and had ſhe come before he had left the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs, her Reſentment might have been more Fatal. <hi>Mademoiſelle des Jardins,</hi> contrary to the Idea that <hi>Strada</hi> gives of her, ſays, Her anger was the more Juſtifyable, having granted this <hi>Counterfeit Sebastian,</hi> many innocent Favours, which this Accident
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:98570:76"/>made her think Criminal.</p>
               <p>Her Averſion bearing a Proportion to her Former Kindneſs, made her fly from one Extream to another. She ſent, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to the Eſtates, That he was a <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit,</hi> which ſhe had diſcovered by the many Contradictions, and different Stories, ſhe found him in; Making a Voyage into <hi>Portugal,</hi> more to raiſe him Enemies for his Perfidiouſneſs, than for the obtaining her Son <hi>Rainuccio</hi> that Crown. And as her An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſaw plainer, than her Love; ſo it was more Active.</p>
               <p>The Circumſtances of the true <hi>Sebaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> Death, were examined by the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the Eſtates: His defeat at <hi>Tamiſta,</hi> was not ſo general, but that ſeveral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Note could give an Account of their Princes Fate. They all affirmed, They had followed him to the Side of the River <hi>Muca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen:</hi> Some added, They ſaw him drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there: And others ſaid, They had like to have periſh't, by endeavouring to Save him. This Story no way agreed with what <hi>Xerine</hi> affirmed, of finding him in the middle of the Battle. But that which made moſt againſt him, was, the Account ſhe gave of the Cloths he was wounded in. The King's Officers affirming, that they were no way like thoſe he had on that Day.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:98570:77"/>But Nature had made the Subject, ſo like the Prince, and he ſo ſupported the Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance by his Wit, and Courage, that they knew not what to reſolve. The more they examined, the greater Difficulties aroſe. It was a horrid Crime, to refuſe their Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Prince, his Crown: And it could be no leſs, to give it to an <hi>Impostor.</hi> But the Death of the <hi>Counterfeit,</hi> determined the Matter.</p>
               <p>The Politicians look't on this Union, of <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> with the <hi>Moors,</hi> as very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to <hi>Portugal:</hi> He had Married <hi>Xeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi> by a moſt Signal Infidelity, charmed with her Beauty, before he came to <hi>Affrica:</hi> She drew him from among the Dead, and was Married to him, before the Old Prince <hi>Boabdelin,</hi> at <hi>Hoſcore;</hi> and it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to bring any Obſtacle, by reaſon of the Difference of Religion; ſhe having promiſed to become a <hi>Christian,</hi> and kept her word as ſoon as ſhe Landed in <hi>Portugal.

               <p>This Declaration he found neceſſary, for the Peace of his Conſcience; <hi>Xerine</hi> having had a Son by him, who might have cauſed much diſturbance.

But this is the true Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Voldemar the Second,</hi> Marquis and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> was the Thirteenth deſcended in a Right Line, from <hi>Albert de L'Ours,</hi> of the Family of the Earls of <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cagne,</hi> who bore that Dignity: From which <hi>Albert,</hi> are alſo deſcended the Dukes of <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Lavemburg,</hi> and the Princes of <hi>Anhalt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Voldemar</hi> was the Son of <hi>Henry,</hi> ſtiled <hi>Without Land,</hi> who dyed in 1313. and of <hi>Agnes,</hi> or as others ſay, <hi>Matilda de Sanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>huſe;</hi> the two Electors, <hi>John the Third,</hi> and <hi>Voldemar the Firſt,</hi> who preceded him, were his great Uncles, whom he Succeeded.</p>
               <p>He had ſcarcely been three years <hi>Elector,</hi> when a Fit of Devotion, according to the Cuſtom of thoſe Times, perſwaded him to go a Pilgrimage, to the <hi>Holy Land.</hi> He left his Brother <hi>John the Fourth</hi> in Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his Country; and diſcharged all
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:98570:80"/>his Servants, except two, whom he reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for his Voyage; not giving his Brother, his Relations, nor Subjects, any Account which way he travelled, nor what adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures befell him in his Journey. For indeed, there were then no Poſts in uſe, it being difficult ſending from Forreign Countrys, unleſs by expreſs Meſſengers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Voldemar</hi> believed he had taken ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Care of the Succeſſion, his Brother be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only left alive, of the Eldeſt Branch; though in a ſhort time, there had been Nineteen Perſons of the ſame; who by Wars, and Inveterate contentions, for Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice and Ambition, drew <hi>God's diſpleaſure</hi> on the Family, and were ſuddenly ſcattered, like the Duſt of the Earth. He obliged his Subjects, not to receive the Princes of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halt,</hi> who were of their Houſe of the <hi>Counts</hi> of <hi>Aſcagne,</hi> for this Sovereigns, in Caſe his Brother and He ſhould dye without Heirs. This their Subjects had Sworn juſtly to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey and execute: But it not being Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized by the <hi>Electors,</hi> nor approved in the Empire; the Emperor <hi>Lewis</hi> thought he had Power to diſpoſe of it, when he ſhould receive News of <hi>Voldemar</hi>'s Death.</p>
               <p>He left his Country in the Year, 1322, and appeared not till Three and Twenty Years after, being in 1345. His Brother,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:98570:80"/>who govern'd in his Abſence dyed Four and Twenty Days after he departed: I know not whether by Sickneſs or Poiſon. However, <hi>Lewis of Bavaria,</hi> then poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Empire, diſpoſed of the Electorate, inveſting in it his Eldeſt Son <hi>Lewis,</hi> by his Firſt Wife <hi>Beatrix</hi> of <hi>Poland,</hi> as a vacant Fief of the Empire.</p>
               <p>Moſt of the <hi>German</hi> Hiſtories tell this much in Favour of the Houſe of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> as follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rodolph,</hi> Duke and Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> deſign'd to take the Electorate of <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi> from <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> Son to the Emperor <hi>Lewis the Fourth,</hi> who had In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted him in it, after the Death of <hi>John the Fourth,</hi> State-holder, and Governor of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> in the Abſence of <hi>Voldemar,</hi> his Elder Brother. <hi>Rodolph</hi> pretended, that being of the Houſe of <hi>Aſcagne,</hi> of which <hi>Voldemar</hi> was the Head, He ought to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs it, before any Other; or, at leaſt, ſome Prince of his Family, ſince Two Electorates could not poſſibly be in one, and the ſame Perſon.</p>
               <p>The better to compaſs his Deſign, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported his Couſin, the Elector <hi>Voldemar,</hi> was alive, who had not appeared in Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Three Years; Till underſtanding how matters went, after many Pilgrimages to
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:98570:81"/>Holy Places, like an ordinary Man, and having eſcap't from the Captivity, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment of the Infidels, he was now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his Country; and to perſonate this Prince, he brought on the Stage, for a Principal Actor in this Tragedy, a Miller of <hi>Landreſtaw,</hi> or as others ſay of <hi>Beltztize,</hi> called <hi>James Rebok,</hi> a Cunning Fellow, and a Subtle Lyer, being near the Age of <hi>Volde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,</hi> with ſomething of his Meen, &amp; Shape; as much as ſo many years abſence, the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of his Hair, the Miſery and Trouble he had ſuffered, with the Weakneſs of Age, could allow or perſwade. He had Lived many Years in <hi>Saxony,</hi> where he was throughly inſtructed, in the Life and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of <hi>Voldemar.</hi> His Application and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, made his Deceit very Succeſsful; for to all Perſons he ſeemingly gave emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Proofs, that he was no Counterfeit, but the true <hi>Marquis Voldemar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The noiſe of his Return from <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> and <hi>Turky,</hi> where he had ſo many Years been detained, ſpread through the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and all <hi>Germany</hi> over; he being aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Emperor <hi>Charles the Fourth,</hi> who was alſo King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> Grand-ſon of the Emperor <hi>Henry the Seventh,</hi> who brought that Dignity into his Family, of <hi>Luthzel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg.</hi> This Prince recommended him to the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:98570:81"/>Cyrcles of the Empire, and ſeverely treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many of his Enemies. The Occaſion of his Enmity to <hi>Lewis the Elector,</hi> was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he got from his Brother <hi>Henry, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet</hi> Counteſs of <hi>Tyrol,</hi> with her vaſt For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
               <p>His other Friends were the Dukes of <hi>Brunſwick, Pomerania,</hi> and <hi>Mekelbourg,</hi> the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Magdebourg,</hi> Primate of <hi>Germany,</hi> beſides Fifteen others: The moſt Zealous for his Intereſt, being thoſe of his own Family, the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and the Princes of <hi>Anhalt;</hi> ſo that he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted very little, of expelling the Elector <hi>Lew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is of Bavaria.</hi>

               <p>This Blow extreamly leſſened <hi>Lewis</hi>'s Courage, and reduced his Affairs to ſuch a Point, that many Cities opened their Gates to the Governour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lewis,</hi> tired with the War, (which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Carion,</hi> in his Life of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> laſted Nine whole Years; though <hi>Lunclavius,</hi> in his <hi>German Hiſtory,</hi> mentions Three only) went into his Earldom of <hi>Tyrol,</hi> which he had had by his Wife <hi>Margaret,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> Duke of <hi>Carinthia,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Tyrol,</hi> leaving the <hi>Marquiſate</hi> and <hi>Electorate</hi> of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> to his Brothers, <hi>Lewis</hi> of the ſame Name, ſirnamed the <hi>Roman,</hi> with <hi>Otho</hi> his Youngeſt: The Emperour <hi>Charles the Fourth</hi> confirming by his Letter Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents at <hi>Budiſſine,</hi> in the Year 1350. his Transferring the <hi>Electorate</hi> to his two ſaid Brothers.</p>
               <p>This Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> had (as we may ſay) extreamly longed for the <hi>Electorſhip;</hi> being vext, that the Emperour <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Bavaria</hi> had been more Fortunate than he,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:98570:83"/>in diſpoſing it to his Eldeſt Son, when the Death of <hi>Voldemar</hi> was reported. <hi>Lewis,</hi> the Eldeſt of the Three Brothers, in Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Brandenbourg,</hi> deceaſed in 1361. and <hi>Maynard,</hi> his Eldeſt Son, left the World before he was Fourteen Years old, though Married, yet having no Heirs: He was born in 1349. and dyed in 1363. The Two remaining Brothers, the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Otho,</hi> conſented by their Agreement with the Emperour <hi>Charles,</hi> to exclude their neareſt Relations, if they dyed without Heirs Male; and ſubſtitute <hi>Winceſlaus,</hi> his Eldeſt Son, Elector: But if neither He, nor the Emperour left a Son, then it ſhould paſs to <hi>John,</hi> Marquis of <hi>Moravia.</hi> They allowed <hi>Winceſlaus</hi> to uſe the Arms and Title of Marquis of <hi>Brandenbourg;</hi> obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging their Subjects to ſwear Allegiance to him. This Agreement was ſigned at <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remberg,</hi> in 1363. where it is ſtill to be ſeen.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Roman</hi> dying without Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, in 1366. left in poſſeſſion hereof <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho</hi> his Brother, Son-in-law to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, by the Marriage of his Daughter <hi>Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes;</hi> who being alſo without Children, conſented to ſell the <hi>Marquiſate</hi> and <hi>Electo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> of <hi>Brandenbourg,</hi> in his Life-time, for Two Hundred Thouſand <hi>Hungarian</hi> Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats,

               <p>All theſe Conſiderations make me rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably conclude, they either thought him Living, and had ſome News of him; or were perſwaded, the Emperour <hi>Lewis</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gave his Son the Adminiſtration of the <hi>Marquiſate</hi> and <hi>Electorate</hi> of <hi>Brandenbourg,</hi> till he returned, or his Death was better confirmed.</p>

               <p>THere's none can be ſo ignorant in Hiſtory, as not to have heard of <hi>Tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain,</hi> Emperour of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and of the Victory he gain'd over <hi>Bajazet,</hi> the Firſt of that Name, Emperor of the <hi>Turks.</hi> In the <hi>Turkiſh Annals,</hi> theſe two Monarchs are called, the one <hi>Temir Can;</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Gilderum Can.</hi> The Title <hi>Can,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Lord,</hi> being commonly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to any other <hi>Tartar</hi> Prince, or <hi>Turkiſh</hi>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:98570:87"/>Lord. But the Name of <hi>Tamberlain</hi> or <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>merland,</hi> was given him becauſe he was Lame; which <hi>Land</hi> expreſſes in the <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Tongue: Some called him <hi>Temir Cuth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> ſignifying in the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Language, a <hi>Fortunate Sword.</hi> His Sirnames were, <hi>The Terrour and Deſolation of the Eaſt, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror &amp; Clades Orientis.</hi> He alſo ſtiled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the <hi>Wrath of God,</hi> or <hi>the Inſtrument of his Indignation.</hi> As for <hi>Bajazet,</hi> he was Named <hi>Gilderum,</hi> or (as others ſay) <hi>Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim;</hi> which, in the Language of the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,</hi> ſignifies the <hi>Terrour of Thunder and Lightning.</hi> The <hi>Greeks</hi> called him <hi>Lelapa;</hi> that is, a <hi>Violent Torrent.</hi> The Impoſture of this Falſe <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> who called himſelf <hi>the true Son of Bajazet,</hi> (certainly believed to have been killed in this great Battle, where his Father was defeated, and made a Priſoner) obliges me to look backward, and tell you of <hi>Bajazet,</hi> with the Subject and Circumſtances of the War.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bajazet</hi> was a moſt Cruel, and Bloody Parricide; being the Firſt, who taught the Princes of his Family, to Imbrew their Hands in the Blood of their neareſt Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; he cauſing his Brother <hi>Jacup</hi> or <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> to be ſtrangled, whom <hi>Paulus Jovius</hi> calls, <hi>Solyman.</hi> His Ambition was ſo great,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:98570:88"/>that without having any right, but the ſharper <hi>Scymitar,</hi> he drove many Soveraign Princes out of their Countrys: As <hi>Techrin,</hi> Prince of <hi>Erzingue,</hi> or <hi>Erzrum,</hi> in the Greater <hi>Armenia,</hi> whom ſome call <hi>Scander,</hi> and make him King alſo of <hi>Armenia;</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Prince of <hi>Germian,</hi> the <hi>Duzinon,</hi> or Lord of <hi>Adem,</hi> and others, ſadly experimented. He had alſo much Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and made great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſtations, in the Countrys of <hi>Emanuel,</hi> Emperour of the <hi>Eaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe expelled Princes being thus cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed, went in Perſon to implore the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of <hi>Tamberlain,</hi> againſt the Tyranny and Injuſtice of <hi>Bajazet:</hi> The ſame <hi>Greek</hi> Emperour groaning under the ſevere Yoak of this Tyrant, paying him Three Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Thouſand Crowns Tribute every Year; (<hi>Tres myriadas Auriorum,</hi> as <hi>Carion</hi> has it in his <hi>Chronicle</hi>) was conſtrained to ſurrender up the City of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> to him, which the Tyrant had ſo often Beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in vain; giving him alſo Hoſtages, and being Obliged to furniſh ſuch number of Souldiers for his Wars; this made him alſo ſend Ambaſſadours, to repreſent his miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable condition.</p>

                  </gap> of <hi>Baja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zet. Tamberlain</hi> was pleaſed to hear him expreſs what Glory it would be to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, if he ſhould deliver the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and the other Princes, from ſo unjuſt a Tyranny. The <hi>Tartar</hi> was ſo ſenſibly touched with their Misfortunes, that he diſpatched away a Herald, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire Juſtice on their behalf from <hi>Bajazet;</hi> at the ſame time, ſending a very Rich Veſt, which is always by them preſented from a Superior to an Inferior.</p>
               <p>This ſo enraged the <hi>Turk,</hi> that a War was ſoon declared; <hi>Bajazet</hi> bringing an Army of Eight Hundred Thouſand Men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Field, (<hi>Paulus Jovius</hi> ſays a Million.) where in a bloody Fight, he was abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defeated, and taken Priſoner. The <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh Annals</hi> mention not the numbers of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Army, only that <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s was as nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous as <hi>Tamberlain</hi>'s. And that the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s defeat proceeded from the generoſity of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> in freeing of <hi>Dieſt,</hi> and other Nations, as <hi>Germian, Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tez,</hi>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:98570:89"/>&amp;c. which <hi>Bajazet</hi> had ſubjugated, whoſe Princes were in <hi>Tamberlains</hi> Army.</p>
               <p>There was none but <hi>Bulcis</hi> or <hi>Bulcogli,</hi> for ſo they called <hi>George, Son of the Deſpot</hi> of <hi>Servia,</hi> who followed not the good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, endeavouring to exterminate the Tyrant, by abandoning him as the reſt did. His Men behaved themſelves ſo well (to the Glory of the Chriſtians) that <hi>Tamberlain</hi> cry'd to thoſe about him, <hi>See how valiant and reſolute thoſe</hi> Dervices <hi>are! Proh quam feroces &amp; truculenti; ſunt iſti Derviſii;</hi> till ſome of his Great Officers told him, <hi>They were Chriſtians, and not that ſort of Religious Turks, called</hi> Dervices <hi>&amp;</hi> Turlacks. The Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory fell on <hi>Tamberlain</hi>'s ſide, One Hundred and Fifty Thouſand Men being Killed upon the Place. This Battle was Fought in the Year 1399, and according to the moſt probable Opinion, in the great Plain called <hi>Caſſobe,</hi> or <hi>Deſcanards,</hi> near Mount <hi>Stella;</hi> Memorable for the Famous Defeat, that <hi>Pompey the Great</hi> gave there to <hi>Mithridates</hi> King of <hi>Pontus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I find very different Accounts of this Action; but follow the <hi>Turkiſh Annals,</hi> which ſay, that <hi>Zelebis,</hi> or the <hi>Noble Muſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha,</hi> (the Name of <hi>Zelebis</hi> being given to all the Children of the <hi>Turkiſh Emperor</hi>) was killed in this Fight: And he being the

               </p>
               <p>And the <hi>Turkiſh Annals</hi> call him Inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, for this reaſon, that when <hi>Gilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> or <hi>Bajazet</hi> was taken, and brought to him, he conducted him to his Tent, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him on foot with great Honour: <hi>Gilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> was on Horſe-back, becauſe of his Wounds, ſupported by <hi>Tamberlain's</hi> Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and being brought in, they both ſate down, and eat together: <hi>Tamberlain</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus to him; <hi>Prince, we ought to give God infinite thanks, and to ſing Hymns of Praiſe to him, that he has given me, who am a poor Lame Man, ſo vaſt an Empire; exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from the furtheſt Parts of</hi> India, <hi>to the Gates of</hi> Sivas, <hi>which is</hi> Sebaſte: <hi>And to Thee, from the Walls of this ſame City, to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of</hi> Hungary. God <hi>having thus diſpoſed ſo great a Part of the World between us, what

'Tis for this his great Goodneſs, that we ought to make him our Acknowledgments: It may be, thou haſt not done this heretofore, as thou oughteſt; but haſt been ungrateful to his Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: for which Reaſon, this misfortune is come upon thee. Philip Camerarius,</hi> in the 54th. Chapter of his <hi>Hiſtorical Meditations,</hi> makes him continue it further, as follows: <hi>Can we think the Soveraign Diſpoſer of the World, thought us the moſt worthy, to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ſo many Millions, who are wiſer and ſtronger than we? That it ſhould pleaſe Him, that Thou, who art almoſt blind, ſhouldeſt be Emperor of the</hi> Turks? <hi>And I, who am a</hi> Tartar, <hi>and Lame, be the Soveraign of ſo many People? No certainly, it was not our Merit, but a pure Effect of his Grace and Bounty.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Tamberlain</hi> ſent him Doggs and Hawks, either to divert him in his Trouble, or reproach his extraordinary Delight in thoſe Creatures.

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:98570:92"/>Years after <hi>Tamberlain's</hi> Famous Victory; a certain Man, called <hi>Duſmes Muſtapha,</hi> pretending to be the Son of <hi>Can Gilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> or <hi>Bajazet,</hi> appeared in <hi>Romania.</hi> And although <hi>Mahomet the Firſt,</hi> and <hi>Amurath the Second,</hi> was aſſured, that he was killed at <hi>Mount Stella;</hi> yet the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> Emperor <hi>Emanuel Paleologus,</hi> would never believe it; but always thought him the true <hi>Muſtapha;</hi> and by giving him his utmoſt Aſſiſtance, pulled many Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſſes on his own Head. <hi>Amurath</hi> offered him great Advantages, not to meddle with their Quarrel; but to let them determine it among themſelves, with their own Arms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Carion,</hi> in his <hi>Chronicle,</hi> ſpeaks not of <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> as an <hi>Impoſtor;</hi> but ſays, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> perceiving <hi>Amurath</hi> to raiſe the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Name and Power, after that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Overthrow at <hi>Mount Stella,</hi> where his Grandfather loſt both his Glory and Liberty; and that he attacked all the little <hi>Chriſtian Princes,</hi> who had depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on the <hi>Eaſtern Empire,</hi> to extirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate one after another; by their Spoils, ſeeking to repair his own Loſſes; though they moſt Religiouſly obſerved the Peace with his Father.

               <p>This Prince, whither True or Falſe, is uncertain, lived ſometimes at <hi>Verdari,</hi> a little City of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> bearing the Name of a River, which runs by it; where ſeverall Lords of the Family of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renoſes,</hi> took his Party: Aſſiſted with whoſe Forces, he Beſieged the City <hi>Serra,</hi> which, with its Fortreſs, he forced to a Surrender.

               <p>
                  <hi>Zunaites,</hi> Prince of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> who had been Priſoner with the <hi>Impoſtor Muſtapha,</hi> in the ſtrong Fortreſs of <hi>Monemuaſia,</hi> which was the antient <hi>Epidaurus,</hi> armed alſo for him.

               <p>Having raiſed this Army, he left <hi>Adria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> and Marched ſtreight to <hi>Burſa;</hi> and on the way, finding his new <hi>Vizier,</hi> the <hi>Baſſa Bajazet,</hi> was conſpiring againſt him; he cauſed him to be Excecuted publickly, as a Traytor, within one days Journey of <hi>Burſa:</hi> Thus paying with an Ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Death, his double Treaſon.</p>

                  <hi>Oſman,</hi> one of the Chief Heads of the <hi>Ottoman</hi>-Family, the better to Eſtabliſh his Greatneſs, made a Friendſhip and Ally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with Three little Princes; by whoſe Aſſiſtance, he extraordinarily advanced his own Affairs, and gained many great Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries over the Chriſtians.

               <p>
                  <hi>Amurath</hi> recalled him to the Port from <hi>Niſar,</hi> the antient <hi>Nicoceſaria,</hi> often called alſo <hi>Tocat,</hi> the Chief City of <hi>Capadocia;</hi> where he was under Reſtraint, kept like a Priſoner; giving him, with his Liberty,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:98570:94"/>the Command of his Army: <hi>Mechemet,</hi> without ſtaying at <hi>Burſa,</hi> March't to <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padi,</hi> or <hi>

By this, and other Arts, he drew to his Maſter <hi>Amurath's</hi> ſide, the moſt conſiderable Lords and Souldiers in

                  <hi>Duſmes</hi> Army, (as <hi>Laonicius</hi> reports at large) which over-threw all his Affairs, without Hopes of any Re-eſtabliſhment; reducing him to the utmoſt Extremities. <hi>Duſmes Muſtapha,</hi> and <hi>Amurath,</hi> both ſent Ambaſſadors to the Emperor of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople, Johannes Paleologus,</hi> to obtain his Aſſiſtance, making great Offers, and ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciting his Miniſters with mighty Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</p>
               <p>This Affair was much debated in the Councel of State; The Reaſons of both Sides being conſidered, the Emperor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared for <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> who was his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whom he had begun to oblige, when he was in Priſon: And therefore promiſed himſelf more from his grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, than <hi>Amurath</hi> would ever do. This had great Reaſon to fright <hi>Amurath's</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and doubtleſs, had it been known, the greater part of his Captains would have declared for his Enemy: But his Ambaſſadors, foreſeeing the danger of ſuch a Report, returned with ſpeed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this denyal, to give the Army an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Expedition; but <hi>Mechemet,</hi> the <hi>Michalogli,</hi> who was a cunning Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, and a <hi>Greek,</hi> though he had abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Country, with his Faith, cauſed it to be reported, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> were

               </p>
               <p>After he had made this Prayer, the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the Battle ſoon alter'd: For <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath,</hi> rallying his Routed Troops, and with Fury charging this half Victorious Army, in a ſhort ſpace defeated, and ruined it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely.</p>
               <p>Thus did <hi>God</hi> ſhew his Judgment on the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> for having abuſed and violated, contrary to Juſtice, their Faith given in his
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:98570:97"/>Name; as both the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Hiſtories agree. Though <hi>Callimachus</hi> ſays, This matter was ſo ſecretly done, that the Publick could never know certainly, that any ſuch Gage was put into <hi>Amurath</hi>'s Hands.</p>
               <p>The Circumſtances of this Great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſter, makes us obſerve, That the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which the Emperour gave to the Falſe <hi>Mustapha,</hi> and the Avarice of the <hi>Genoeſe</hi>-Merchant, who ſold a Paſſage into <hi>Europe,</hi> to <hi>Amurath's</hi> Troops, were two dreadful blows to <hi>Chriſtendome;</hi> which has often endured its greateſt Loſſes by the blameable Conduct of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> them ſelves. But to return to our Story.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amurath</hi> having paſſed the <hi>Straight,</hi> encamped with his Army upon the Plain <hi>Ezea,</hi> which is near to <hi>Maitos,</hi> on the ſide of <hi>Theſſaly.

Here the miſerable <hi>Impoſtor</hi> was Hanged
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:98570:98"/>over the Battlements of the City-Wall.</p>
               <p>For certain, Death is always equally the Puniſhment, or the Misfortune of thoſe, who of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Family aim at, or ſeem to have any pretence to the Scepter. 'Tis neither the Innocence of Age, the Merit, the Proximity of Blood, the Sincerity, nor Juſtice of the Cauſe, can ever preſerve them, if they fall into the Hands of the Conqueror.</p>
               <p>I have taken this Lamentable End of <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> word for word, out of the <hi>Turkiſh Annals,</hi> and the <hi>Pandects of Lun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clavius,</hi> with the Hiſtory of that War, and its Accidents. Indeed, till <hi>Sultan A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murath</hi> was delivered from this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Opponent, he could not think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſecure, nor faſt ſettled in his Throne: Which happened in the Year of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> 1425, and of the <hi>Hegira,</hi> or <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Computation,</hi> 827. It is true, that one of his Brothers, alſo named <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> who was in <hi>Natolia,</hi> gave him much Trouble, but he overcame it; and get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him into his Power, cauſed him to have his Throat Cut: Others ſay, to be Strangled at <hi>Nizar,</hi> or <hi>Nicea,</hi> where he was delivered into his Hands by his own Governour. Which ſeems to have

               <p>
                  <hi>Du Verdier</hi> writing the Adventures, and Death of our <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> believes him no <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor;</hi> and tells his laſt Flight, and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Cataſtrophe in another manner, as follows: After he found himſelf (ſays he) deſerted, he cryed out, <hi>Oh, how hard it is to preſerve a Great Heart againſt the Power of Fortune!</hi> There were many Proofs of his Courage; His Pretenſion to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, was no weak Mark of it. But a Crown was then no longer in Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie: The Queſtion was, How to ſave his Life? For which purpoſe, when his Troops left him, he no more thought of Glory, Honour, nor Intereſt: but only fled, quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all his Pretenſions, for the Hopes of Life; which, for a little while, he preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, by the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who received him kindly into their Veſſels, and gave him the Opportunity of gaining the Fortreſs of <hi>Gallipoli.</hi> But all this, only ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ruine him more ſhamefully; for <hi>Amurath</hi> purſued him ſo obſtinately, that he beſieged him in the Place he choſe for his Retreat; compelling him to get out of it in mean Equipage; and at laſt, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him hid in a Buſh on the Mountain <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganum,</hi>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:98570:99"/>he cauſed him to be ſtrangled in his Preſence, that he might be ſure he had of him no Competitor left.</p>

                  <hi>Lunclavius,</hi> in the 83. <hi>Chap. of his Pandects,</hi> makes a Parallel between this <hi>Muſtapha</hi> and <hi>Voldemar;</hi> ſaying, That <hi>Two Eggs were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more alike, than theſe two Men were:</hi> Whom he puts in the Rank of <hi>Impoſters.</hi> Both of them had mighty Allies; <hi>Muſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha</hi> having for him, <hi>John Paleologus,</hi> the <hi>Grecian</hi> Emperor; and <hi>Voldemar</hi> had <hi>Charles</hi> the Fourth, Emperor and King of <hi>Germany,</hi> whoſe Empire was more Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing than the Others.</p>
